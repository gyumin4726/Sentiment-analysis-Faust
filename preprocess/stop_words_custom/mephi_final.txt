thine earthly self behind cast
lofty instinct thus—

daren’t say how—to pluck final flower
yes findest unpleasant
moral right cry “shame” present
dares chaste ears declare
chaste hearts notwithstanding cannot spare
and all grudge pleasure
lying thyself moderate measure
course wilt long endure
already o’erexcited

madness horror sure
enough that love sits lonely yonder
things saddened oppressed
thoughts yearnings seek tenderer fonder—

we seems entered newly
sphere dreams enchanted
bidding guide truly
feet forwards planted
vast desert spaces
see swiftly changing places
trees trees beside trooping
crags stooping
rocky snouts outgrowing—
hear snoring hear blowing
o’er stones grasses flowing
stream streamlet seek hollow
hear noises songs follow
hear tender lovepetitions
voices heavenly visions
sounds hope love undying
echoes like traditions
old days come faint hollow
hoohoo shoohoo nearer hover

boisterous guests approach invited
old ribs rock retreating

frightened owlets scattered
hearken pillars shattered
evergreen palaces shaking
boughs groaning breaking
treetrunks terribly thunder
roots twisting asunder
frightfully intricate crashing

yonder special light there’s something shining clearer
within bushes i’ve mind see
come on we’ll slip little nearer
see motley flames among heather
lively club together
smaller circles alone
enigmas also knotted
leave multitude riot
house quiet
old transmitted trade
greater world little worlds made
see starknude young witches congregate
old ones veiled hidden shrewdly
account kind treat rudely
trouble’s small fun great
hear noise instruments attuning—
vile din learn bear crooning

thine obligation newly earning
little space say’st friend
look yonder canst scarcely see end
hundred fires along ranks burning
dance chat cook drink court

twenty years since first determined attempt
faust metres time although
score translations first part three four
second part existence experiment
made prose version hayward seemed accepted
standard default anything satisfactory critics
generally sustaining translator views concerning
secondary importance poetry practically discouraged
attempt familiar rhythmical expression
needs nature devoted necessary love patience
adequate reproduction great work goethe’s life
brooks first undertake task publication
first part induced time
give design previous version exhibited
abnegation translator’s tastes habits thought
reverent desire present purest care
conscience work performed apparent
state reluctance seemed
deficiencies—a lack lyrical fire fluency
passages occasional lowering tone use
words literal equivalent plan
adopted brooks entirely own
residence germany careful study parts faust
satisfied field open—that means
furnished poetical affinity two languages
exhausted—nothing remained follow essential
particulars example confirmed belief
difficulties way nearly literal thoroughly rhythmical
version faust might overcome loving labor
comparison seventeen translations arbitrary metres
adopted translators sufficiently showed danger allowing
license respect white light goethe’s thought thereby
passed tinted glass minds assumed coloring
each moreover plea selecting different metres hope
producing similar effect unreasonable identical metres
possible
value poetical work first question
considered poet ever understood question thoroughly
goethe himself expressed positive opinion regard
alternative modes presents reported
riemer quoted mrs austin “characteristics goethe”
accepted hayward quite independent views
concerning value find given elsewhere
clearest emphatic manner poetry simply fashion
expression expression absolutely required
certain class ideas poetry indeed distinguished prose
single circumstance utterance whatever man
cannot perfectly uttered rhythmical
useless say naked meaning independent
contrary contributes essentially fullness
meaning poetry endures inherent vitality
forced union two elements intimately
blended mysterious beauty sexes
ancient hermaphroditus attempt represent poetry prose
much like attempting translate music speech
“‘there two maxims translation’ says he ‘the requires
author foreign nation brought manner
regard own other contrary demands
transport him adopt situation
mode speaking peculiarities advantages
sufficiently known instructed persons masterly examples’”
necessary however always alternative
languages kindred equally capable varieties
metrical expression “maxims” observed
goethe true opinion faust ought
given french manner clement marot
undoubtedly felt inadequacy modern french express
naive simple realism passages objection
apply archaic expressions faust
allowed—nay frequently encouraged—in
day
“you right” said goethe “there great mysterious
agencies included various forms poetry substance
‘roman elegies’ expressed tone measure byron’s
‘don juan’ really atrocious effect”—eckermann
“the rhythm” said goethe “is unconscious result poetic mood
stop consider mechanically write
poem become bewildered accomplish nothing real
poetical value”—ibid
“all poetic character rythmically treated
conviction sort poetic prose gradually
introduced show distinction prose
poetry completely lost sight of”—goethe schiller 1797
tycho mommsen excellent essay die kunst des deutschen
uebersetzers aus neueren sprachen goes far say “the metrical
rhymed modelling poetical work essentially germ
being that rather giving up might hope construct
similar work eyes countrymen giving
changing substance immeasurable result followed works
wherein retained—such homer voss
shakespeare tieck schlegel—is incontrovertible evidence
vitality endeavor”
“goethe’s poems exercise great sway
meaning also rhythm language stimulates
composition”—beethoven
various theories greek latin poets
admirably stated dryden preface “translations
ovid’s epistles” wish continue endless
discussion—especially literature needs examples opinions
recent expression however carries much authority
feel bound present considerations accomplished scholar
seems overlooked lewes justly says “the effect
poetry compound music suggestion music
suggestion intermingled words alter alter
effect words poetry not prose simple representatives
objects ideas parts organic whole—they
tones harmony” thereupon illustrates effect
changing certain wellknown stanzas others
equivalent meaning lacking felicity words grace
melody cannot accept valid
lewes purposely omits quality honest translator
exhaust skill endeavoring reproduce turns away
best word phrase lines quotes whereas
translator seeks precisely best word phrase having all
resources language command represent said
another language this task simply mechanical
feel guided by secondary inspiration surrendering
full possession spirit speak
him receives also portion creative power lewes
reaches conclusion “if therefore reflect poem faust
is contains almost every variety style metre
tolerably evident unacquainted
adequate idea translation” certainly
correct wherein something rhythmical variety
beauty retained much
rhythmical character retained long ago shown
carlyle passages translated literally
rhythmically helena fact
instances possibility reciprocally transferring finest
qualities german poetry sufficient
excuse unmetrical faust refer especially

life goethe
lewes gives following advice “the reader
perhaps best succeed first read dr anster’s brilliant
paraphrase carefully go hayward’s prose translation”
singularly variance view expressed dr
anster’s version almost incredible dilution
written other metres hayward’s entirely omits element
poetry
foreign review 1828
freiligrath give walter scott—
“kommt wie der wind kommt wenn wälder erzittern kommt wie die
brandung wenn flotten zersplittern schnell heran schnell herab
schneller kommt al’e—häuptling und bub’ und knapp herr und vasalle”
strodtmann reproduce tennyson—
“es fällt der strahl auf burg und thal und schneeige gipfel reich
sagen viel’ lichter wehn auf blauen seen bergab die wasserstürze
jagen blas hüfthorn blas wiederhall erschallend blas
horn—antwortet echos hallend hallend hallend”
—it dull ear satisfied omission
rhythm rhyme
serious objection however urge hayward’s
prose restraints verse flung aside
expect least accurate reproduction sense
spirit tone genius language
permit far given reproduction hayward
occasionally mistakes exact meaning german text but
wherever two phrases used express meaning equal
fidelity frequently selects less grace
strength beauty

sorrow voices strange throng”
translators notice followed hayward mistaking lied

close soldier’s song is—
“kühn das mühen
herrlich der lohn
und die soldaten
ziehen davon”
literally

hayward translates—

ordinary use bare prosaic character receive fairer
finer quality place verse prose translator

beauty value rhythm likely overlook delicate

appreciation verse “in giving” says “a sort rhythmical
arrangement lyrical parts” object “to convey

fugitive houseless roaming
monster without air rest
like cataract rocks gorges foaming
leaps maddened abyss’s breast

within cabin alpine field
simple homely life commences

what’s
window sacristy
upward th’eternal lamp sends forth glimmer
that lessening sidewards fainter grows dimmer
till darkness closes sky
shadows within bosom gather
meanwhile treasure risen
there behind glimmering see
jewel ring
deck therewith darling girl
that’s indeed painful
bring gift visit
long legs feel fresh existence
knotted staff suffices
need shorten way
along labyrinth vales wander
climb rocky ramparts yonder
wherefrom fountain flings eternal spray
delight steps fain delay
springtime stirs within fragrant birches
firtree feels
limbs escape gentle searches
strangely glimmers hollows
dreary light like dawn
exhalation tracks follows
deepest gorges faint wan
steam rolling vapor sweepeth
burns glow film haze
like tender thread creepeth
like fountain leaps plays
winds away hundred
divided veins valley braids
there corner pressed sundered
detaches spreads fades
gush sparkles incandescent
like scattered showers golden sand—
but see height present
rocky ramparts blazing stand
raves tempest air
fierce blows neck beating
spirit contradiction on i’ll follow straight
planned wisely judge aright
climb brocken’s top walpurgisnight
arbitrarily isolate
better summit own
fire whirling smoke see
seek evil wild confusion
enigmas might find solution
wilt introduce revel
assume part wizard devil
lose pother
fair never another
that
who
two old young sitting
they’ve danced already fitting
ah midst sprang
red mouse mouth—sufficient reason
saw i—
mephisto seest there
alone far girl pale fair
falters on way scarce knowing
fettered feet stay going
confess seems
kindly margaret she
forsooth eyes whom dying
hand loving pressure closed
breast whereon lying—
body sweet beside reposed
woe rapture ensnare
gaze cannot tear
and strange around fairest throat
single scarlet band gleaming
broader knifeblade seeming
misery despair long wretchedly astray face earth
imprisoned gracious illstarred creature shut
dungeon criminal given fearful torments
come this—treacherous contemptible spirit
concealed me—stand then—stand roll devilish eyes
wrathfully head stand defy thine intolerable
presence imprisoned irretrievable misery delivered evil
spirits condemning unfeeling man lulled
meanwhile insipid dissipations concealed
increasing wretchedness suffered go helplessly ruin
dog abominable monster transform him infinite spirit transform
reptile dogshape pleased often
night scamper roll feet
unsuspecting wanderer hang shoulders fell
transform favorite likeness crawl
belly dust me—that trample him outlawed
foot first woe woe human soul grasp
sink depths
misery—that first writhing deathagony eyes
eternal forgiver expiate guilt others
misery single pierces marrow life
calmly grinning fate thousands
gnash devouring teeth fills horrible
disgust mighty glorious spirit vouchsafed thine
apparition knowest heart soul fetter
feloncomrade feeds mischief gluts ruin
rescue her woe fearfullest curse
thousands ages
take thither free
that too murder death world monster
take thither say liberate her
away
weave round ravenstone
soaring up sweeping down bowing bending
scatter devote doom
shudder long unfelt comes o’er
mankind’s collected woe o’erwhelms
dwells within dark damp walls
crime delusion dear
what delay free her
dread see her
on shrinking lingers death near
my mother harlot
put death
father varlet
eaten
little sister good
laid bones wood
damp moss clay
beautiful bird o’ wood
fly away fly away
faust
dream lover listens near
rattling chain rustling straw hear
margaret
woe woe come death bitterness
faust
hush hush hour come frees
margaret
man pity distress
cries wake guards seize
margaret
who headsman unto power
could give
thou’rt come midnighthour
mercy live
is’t soon enough morning chime run
young young
death comes ruin
i too fair undoing
love near he’s far
torn lies wreath scattered blossoms are
seize violently
spare done
vainly entreat
never chanced days meet
outlive misery
i
away
longer stayest
made dearly rue
come follow darling bold
i’ll clasp soon warmth thousandfold
follow beg
margaret
surely certainly
i come on
come come night already vanisheth
o past past
words slay
feel’st i come
freedom
canst open stands door
i’ll stay
recall wandering will
step free last
words prayers nothing worth
i’ll venture bear forth
day dawns dearest dearest
ne’er born
mephistopheles
off you’re lost ere morn
useless talking delaying praying
horses neighing
morning twilight near
live

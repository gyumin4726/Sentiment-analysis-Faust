prologue in heaven

the lord the heavenly host afterwards
mephistopheles




raphael

the sunorb sings in emulation
mid brotherspheres his ancient round
his path predestined through creation
he ends with step of thundersound
the angels from his visage splendid
draw power whose measure none can say
the lofty works uncomprehended
are bright as on the earliest day


gabriel

and swift and swift beyond conceiving
the splendor of the world goes round
days edenbrightness relieving
the awful nights intense profound
the oceantides in foam are breaking
against the rocks deep bases hurled
and both the spheric race partaking
eternal swift are onward whirled


michael

and rival storms abroad are surging
from sea to land from land to sea
a chain of deepest action forging
round all in wrathful energy
there flames a desolation blazing
before the thunders crashing way
lord messengers are praising
the gentle movement of day


the three

though by them uncomprehended
from these the angels draw their power
and all works sublime and splendid
are bright as in creations hour


mephistopheles

since o lord deignst to approach again
and ask how we do in manner kindest
and heretofore to meet myself wert fain
among menials my face findest
pardon this troop i cannot follow after
with lofty speech though by them scorned and spurned
my pathos certainly move laughter
if hadst not all merriment unlearned
of suns and worlds ive nothing to quoted
how men torment themselves is all ive noted
the little god o the world sticks to the same old way
and is as whimsical as on creations day
life somewhat better might content him
but for the gleam of heavenly light which lent him
he calls reason—thence his powers increased
to far beastlier than any beast
saving gracious presence he to
a longlegged grasshopper appears to
that springing flies and flying springs
and in the grass the same old ditty sings
he lay among the grass he grows in
each bit of dung he seeks to stick his nose in


the lord

nothing more to mention
comst ever with ill intention
findst nothing right on earth eternally


mephistopheles

no lord i find things there bad as they can
mans misery to pity moves my nature
ive scarce the heart to plague the wretched creature


the lord

knowst faust


mephistopheles

the doctor faust


the lord

my servant he


mephistopheles

forsooth he serves you after strange devices
no earthly meat or drink the fool suffices
his spirits ferment far aspireth
half conscious of his frenzied crazed unrest
the fairest stars from heaven he requireth
from earth the highest raptures and the best
and all the near and far that he desireth
fails to subdue the tumult of his breast


the lord

though confused his service unto
i soon lead him to a clearer morning
sees not the gardener while buds his tree
both flower and fruit the future years adorning


mephistopheles

what will you bet theres a chance to gain him
if unto full leave you give
gently my road to train him


the lord

as long as he on earth live
so long i make no prohibition
while mans desires and aspirations stir
he cannot choose but err


mephistopheles

my thanks i find the dead no acquisition
and never cared to have them in my keeping
i much prefer the cheeks where ruddy blood is leaping
and when a corpse approaches close my house
goes with as with the cat the mouse


the lord

enough what asked is granted
turn off this spirit from his fountainhead
to trap him snares planted
and him with downward led
stand abashed when forced to say
a good man through obscurest aspiration
has an instinct of the true way


mephistopheles

agreed but tis a short probation
about my bet i feel no trepidation
if i fulfill my expectation
youll triumph with a swelling breast
dust he eat and with a zest
as did a certain snake my near relation


the lord

therein thourt free according to merits
the like of have never moved my hate
of all the bold denying spirits
the waggish knave least trouble create
mans active nature flagging seeks too soon the level
unqualified repose he learns to crave
whence willingly the comrade him i gave
who works excites and create as devil
but gods sons in love and duty
enjoy the rich the everliving beauty
creative power that works eternal schemes
clasp you in bonds of love relaxing never
and what in wavering apparition gleams
fix in its place with thoughts that stand forever





mephistopheles

i like at times to hear the ancients word
and have a care to most civil
its really kind of such a noble lord
so humanly to gossip with the devil






first part of the tragedy


i

night

a loftyarched narrow gothic chamber faust in a chair at his
desk restless


faust

ive studied philosophy
and jurisprudence medicine—
and alas theology—
from end to end with labor keen
and poor fool with all my lore
i stand no wiser than before
im magister—yea doctor—hight
and straight or crosswise wrong or right
these ten years long with woes
ive led my scholars by the nose—
and see that nothing can known
that knowledge cuts to the bone
im cleverer true than those fops of teachers
doctors and magisters scribes and preachers
neither scruples nor doubts come to smite
nor hell nor devil can longer affright

for this all pleasure am i foregoing
i do not pretend to aught worth knowing
i do not pretend i could a teacher
to help or convert a fellowcreature
too ive neither lands nor gold
nor the worlds least pomp or honor hold—
no dog endure such a curst existence
from magic i seek assistance
that a secret perchance i reach
through spiritpower and spiritspeech
and the bitter task forego
of saying the things i do not know—
that i detect the inmost force
which binds the world and guides its course
its germs productive powers explore
and rummage in empty words no more

o full and splendid moon whom i
have from this desk seen climb the sky
so a midnight—would glow
for the last time beheld my woe
ever thine eye most mournful friend
oer books and papers saw bend
but that i on mountains grand
amid blessed light could stand
with spirits through mountaincaverns hover
float in twilight the meadows over
and freed from the fumes of lore that swathe
to health in dewy fountains bathe

ah this dungeon i see
this drear accursed masonry
where the welcome daylight strains
but duskly through the painted panes
hemmed in by a toppling heap
of books wormeaten gray with dust
which to the vaulted ceiling creep
against the smoky paper thrust—
with glasses boxes round stacked
and instruments together hurled
ancestral lumber stuffed and packed—
such is my world and what a world

and do i ask my heart
falters oppressed with unknown needs
why some inexplicable smart
all movement of my life impedes
alas in living natures stead
where god his human creature set
in smoke and mould the fleshless dead
and bones of beasts surround

fly up and seek the broad free land
and this book of mystery
from nostradamus very hand
ist not sufficient company
when i the starry courses know
and natures wise instruction seek
with light of power my soul glow
as when to spirits spirits speak
tis vain this empty brooding
though guessed the holy symbols
spirits come—ye hover near—
oh if you hear answer



ha what a sudden rapture leaps from this
i view through all my senses swiftly flowing
i feel a youthful holy vital bliss
in every vein and fibre newly glowing
was a god who traced this sign
with calm across my tumult stealing
my troubled heart to joy unsealing
with impulse mystic and divine
the powers of nature around my path revealing
am i a god—so clear mine eyes
in these pure features i behold
creative nature to my soul unfold
what says the sage first i recognize
the spiritworld no closures fasten
sense is shut heart is dead
disciple up untiring hasten
to bathe breast in morningred



how each the whole its substance gives
each in the other works and lives
like heavenly forces rising and descending
their golden urns reciprocally lending
with wings that winnow blessing
from heaven through earth i see them pressing
filling the all with harmony unceasing
how grand a show but ah a show alone
boundless nature how make my own
where you beasts founts of all being shining
whereon hang heavens and earths desire
whereto our withered hearts aspire—
flow feed and am i vainly pining

he turns the leaves impatiently and perceives the sign of the
earthspirit

how otherwise works this sign
spirit of the earth nearer
my powers are loftier clearer
i glow as drunk with newmade wine
new strength and heart to meet the world incite
the woe of earth the bliss of earth invite
and though the shock of storms smite
no crash of shipwreck have power to fright
clouds gather over me—
the moon conceals her light—
the lamps extinguished—
mists rise—red angry rays are darting
around my head—there falls
a horror from the vaulted roof
and seizes
i feel presence spirit i invoke
reveal thyself
ha in my heart what rending stroke
with new impulsion
my senses heave in this convulsion
i feel draw my heart absorb exhaust
and though my life cost

he seizes the book and mysteriously pronounces the sign of
the spirit a ruddy flame flashes the spirit appears in
the flame


spirit

who calls


faust

terrible to see


spirit

long with might attracted
long from my sphere food exacted
and now—

faust

woe i endure not


spirit

to view is thine aspiration
my voice to hear my countenance to see
powerful yearning moveth
am i—what mean perturbation
superhuman shakes souls high calling where
where is the breast which from itself a world did bear
and shaped and cherished—which with joy expanded
to our peer with the spirits banded
where faust whose voice has pierced to
who towards pressed with all thine energy
he who my presence breathing seeing
trembles through all the depths of being
a writhing worm a terrorstricken


faust

of flame i fear
yes i am faust i am peer


spirit

in the tides of life in actions storm
a fluctuant wave
a shuttle free
birth and the grave
an eternal sea
a weaving flowing
life allglowing
at times humming loom tis my hand prepares
the garment of life which the deity wears


faust

who around the wide world wendest
busy spirit how near i feel to


spirit

thourt like the spirit which comprehendest
not




faust

not
whom
i image of the godhead
not like



o death—i know it—tis my famulus
my fairest luck finds no fruition
in all the fullness of my vision
the soulless sneak disturbs

enter wagner in dressinggown and nightcap a lamp in
his hand faust turns impatiently


wagner

pardon i heard your declamation
twas sure an old greek tragedy you read
in such an i crave some preparation
since stands in good stead
ive often heard said a preacher
might learn with a comedian for a teacher


faust

yes when the priest comedian is by nature
as haply and the case


wagner

ah when studies a prisoned creature
that scarce the world on holidays can see—
scarce through a glass by rare occasion
how lead by persuasion


faust

youll neer attain save you know the feeling
save from the soul rises clear
serene in primal strength compelling
the hearts and minds of all who hear
you sit forever gluing patching
you cook the scraps from others fare
and from your heap of ashes hatching
a starveling flame blow bare
take childrens monkeys gaze admiring
if such your taste and content
but neer from heart to heart youll speak inspiring
save your own heart is eloquent


wagner

through delivery orators succeed
i feel that i am far behind indeed


faust

seek the honest recompense
beware a tinkling fool to
with little clear wit and sense
suggest their own delivery
and if thourt moved to speak in earnest
what need that after words yearnest
yes your discourses with their glittering show
where for men twist shredded thought like paper
are unrefreshing as the winds that blow
the rustling leaves through chill autumnal vapor


wagner

ah god but is long
and life alas is fleeting
and oft with zeal my criticduties meeting
in head and breast theres something wrong

how hard is to compass the assistance
whereby rises to the source
and haply ere travels half the course
the poor devil quit existence


faust

is parchment the holy fount before
a draught wherefrom thirst forever slakes
no true refreshment can restore
save what from thine own soul spontaneous breaks


wagner

pardon a great delight is granted
when in the spirit of the ages planted
we mark how ere our times a sage has thought
and how far his work and grandly we have brought


faust

o yes up to the stars at last
listen my friend the ages that are past
are a book with seven seals protected
what you the spirit of the ages call
is nothing but the spirit of you all
wherein the ages are reflected
so oftentimes you miserably mar
at the first glance who sees runs away
an offalbarrel and a lumbergarret
or at the best a punchandjudy play
with maxims most pragmatical and hitting
as in the mouths of puppets are befitting


wagner

but the world—the human heart and brain
of these covets some slight apprehension


faust

yes of the kind which men attain
who dares the childs true name in public mention
the few who thereof something really learned
unwisely frank with hearts that spurned concealing
and to the mob laid bare each thought and feeling
have evermore been crucified and burned
i pray you friend tis the dead of night
our converse suspended


wagner

i have shared your watches with delight
that so our learned talk might extended
tomorrow though ill ask in easter leisure
this and the other question at your pleasure
most zealously i seek for erudition
much do i know—but to know all is my ambition

exit


faust

that brain alone not loses hope whose choice is
to stick in shallow trash forevermore—
which digs with eager hand for buried ore
and when finds an angleworm rejoices

dare such a human voice disturb the flow
around of spiritpresence fullest
and this once my thanks i owe
to of all earths sons the poorest dullest
for torn from that desperate state
which threatened soon to overwhelm my senses
the apparition was so giantgreat
dwarfed and withered all my souls pretences

i image of the godhead who began—
deeming eternal truth secure in nearness—
to sun myself in heavenly light and clearness
and laid aside the earthly man—
i more than cherub whose free force had planned
to flow through natures veins in glad pulsation
to reach beyond enjoying in creation
the life of gods behold my expiation
a thunderword swept from my stand27

with i dare not venture to compare
though i possessed the power to draw near
the power to keep was denied my hand
when that ecstatic moment held
i felt myself so small so great
but ruthlessly repelled
back mans uncertain fate
what i shun whose guidance borrow
i accept that stress and strife
ah every deed of ours no less than every sorrow
impedes the onward march of life

some alien substance more and more is cleaving
to all the mind conceives of grand and fair
when this worlds good is won by our achieving
the better is named a cheat and snare
the fine emotions whence our lives we mould
lie in the earthly tumult dumb and cold
if hopeful fancy once in daring flight
her longings to the infinite expanded
a narrow space contents her quite
since times wild wave so a fortune stranded
care at the bottom of the heart is lurking
her secret pangs in silence working
she restless rocks herself disturbing joy and rest
in newer masks her face is ever drest
by turns as house and land as wife and child presented—
as water fire as poison steel
we dread the blows we never feel
and what we never lose is by lamented

i am not like the gods that truth is felt too deep
the worm am i that in the dust creep—
that while in dust lives and seeks its bread
is crushed and buried by the wanderers tread

is not this dust these walls within them hold
the hundred shelves which cramp and chain
the frippery the trinkets thousandfold
that in this mothy den restrain
i find the help i need
a thousand volumes teach only
that men selftortured everywhere bleed—
and and there happy man sits lonely28
what meanst by that grin hollow skull
save that brain like mine a cloudy mirror
sought once the shining day and in twilight dull29
thirsting for truth went wretchedly to error
instruments forsooth but jeer at
with wheel and cog and shapes uncouth of wonder
i found the portal you the keys should
your wards are deftly wrought but drive no bolts asunder
mysterious in open day
nature retains her veil despite our clamors
that which she not willingly display
cannot wrenched from her with levers screws and hammers
ancient tools whose use i never knew
since my father used moulder
ancient scroll worn smoky hue
since at this desk the dim lamp wont to smoulder
t were better far had i my little idly spent
than to sweat beneath its burden i confess
what from your fathers heritage is lent
earn anew to really possess it30
what serves not is a sore impediment
the moments need creates the thing to serve and bless

tums my gaze to yonder point so lightly
is yonder flask a magnet for mine eyes
whence all around glows the air so brightly
as when in woods at night the mellow moonbeam lies

i hail wondrous rarest vial
i take down devoutly for the trial
mans and wit i venerate in
summary of gentle slumberjuices
essence of deadly finest powers and uses
unto master show favor free
i see and the stings of pain diminish
i grasp and my struggles slowly finish
my spirits floodtide ebbeth more and more
out on the open ocean speeds my dreaming
the glassy flood before my feet is gleaming
a new day beckons to a newer shore

a fiery chariot borne on buoyant pinions
sweeps near i soon ready
to pierce the ethers high unknown dominions
to reach new spheres of pure activity
this godlike rapture this supreme existence
do i but a worm deserve to track
yes resolute to reach some brighter distance
on earths fair sun i turn my back 31
yes dare those gates to fling asunder
which every man fain go slinking by
t is time through deeds this word of truth to thunder
that with the height of gods mans dignity vie
nor from that gloomy gulf to shrink affrighted
where fancy herself to selfborn pangs compel—
to struggle toward that pass benighted
around whose narrow mouth flame all the fires of hell—
to take this step with cheerful resolution
though nothingness should the certain swift conclusion
and come down cup of crystal clearest
fresh from thine ancient cover appearest
so years forgotten to my thought
shonst at old ancestral banquets cheery
the solemn guests madest merry
when wassail to the other brought
the rich and skilful figures oer wrought
the drinkers duty rhymewise to explain them
or in breath below the mark to drain them
from a night of youth my memory caught
to a neighbor i pass never
nor on curious to test my wit endeavor
is a juice whence sleep is swiftly born
fills with browner flood crystal hollow
i chose prepared i follow—
with all my soul the final drink i swallow
a solemn festal cup a greeting to the morn
he sets the goblet to his mouth



chorus of angels32
christ is arisen
joy to the mortal
whom the unmerited
clinging inherited
needs did imprison


faust
what hollow humming what a sharp clear stroke
drives from my lip the goblets at their meeting
announce the booming bells already woke
the first glad hour of easters festal greeting
choirs have begun the sweet consoling chant
which through the night of death the angels ministrant
sang gods new covenant repeating


chorus of women

with spices and precious
balm we arrayed him
faithful and gracious
we tenderly laid him
linen to bind him
cleanlily wound we
ah when we find him
christ no more found we


chorus of angels

christ is ascended
bliss invested him—
woes that molested him
trials that tested him
gloriously ended


faust

why in dust entice with your spell
gentle powerful sounds of heaven
peal rather there where tender natures dwell
your messages i hear but faith has not been given
the dearest child of faith is miracle
i venture not to soar to yonder regions
whence the glad tidings hither float
and from childhood up familiar with the note
to life renews the old allegiance
once heavenly love sent down a burning kiss
my brow in sabbath silence holy
and filled with mystic presage chimed the churchbell slowly
and prayer dissolved in a fervent bliss
a sweet uncomprehended yearning
drove forth my feet through woods and meadows free
and while a thousand tears were burning
i felt a world arise for
these chants to youth and all its sports appealing
proclaimed the springs rejoicing holiday
and memory holds with childish feeling
back from the last the solemn way
sound on hymns of heaven so sweet and mild
my tears gush forth the earth takes back her child


chorus of disciples

has he victoriously
burst from the vaulted
grave and allgloriously
sits exalted
is he in glow of birth
rapture creative near
ah to the woe of earth
are we native
we his aspiring
followers him we miss
weeping desiring
master bliss

chorus of angels

christ is arisen
out of corruptions womb
burst the prison
break from your gloom
praising and pleading him
lovingly needing him
brotherly feeding him
preaching and speeding him
blessing succeeding him
is the master near—
is he





ii


before the citygate




several apprentices

why do you go that way


others

were for the hunters lodge today


the first

saunter to the mill in yonder hollow


an apprentice

go to the river tavern i should say


second apprentice

but its not a pleasant way


the others

and what will you

a third

as goes the crowd i follow


a fourth

come up to burgdorf there youll find good cheer
the finest lasses and the best of beer
and jolly rows and squabbles trust


a fifth

you swaggering fellow is your hide
a third time itching to tried
i wont go there your jolly rows disgust


servantgirl

no—no ill turn and go to town again


another

surely find him by those poplars yonder


the first

thats no great luck for tis plain
youll have him when and where you wander
his partner in the dance youll be—
but what is all your fun to


the other

hes surely not alone today
hell with curlyhead i heard him say


a student

deuce how they step the buxom wenches
come brother we see them to the benches
a strong old beer a pipe that stings and bites
a girl in sunday clothes—these three are my delights


citizens daughter

just see those handsome fellows there
its really shameful i declare—
to follow servantgirls when they
might have the most genteel society today


second student

not quite so fast two others come behind—
those dressed so prettily and neatly
my neighbors of them i find
a girl that takes my heart completely
they go their way with looks demure
but theyll accept after all im sure


the first

no brother not for their formal ways
quick lest our game escape in the press
the hand that wields the broom on saturdays
will best on sundays fondle and caress


citizen

he suits not at all our newmade burgomaster
since hes installed his arrogance grows faster
how has he helped the town i say
things worsen—what improvement names he
obedience more than ever claims he
and more than ever we pay


beggar

good gentlemen and lovely ladies
so red of cheek and fine of dress
behold how needful your aid is
and see and lighten my distress
not vainly sing my ditty
hes only glad who gives away
a holiday that shows your pity
for a harvestday


another citizen

on sundays holidays theres naught i take delight in
like gossiping of war and wars array
when down in turkey far away
the foreign people are afighting
at the window sits with glass and friends
and sees all sorts of ships go down the river gliding
and blesses as home he wends
at night our times of peace abiding


third citizen

yes neighbor thats my notion too
why them break their heads loose their passions
and mix things madly through and through
so we keep our good old fashions


old woman

dear how fine so handsome and so young
who wouldnt lose his heart that met you
dont so proud ill hold my tongue
and what youd like ill undertake to get you


citizens daughter

come agatha i shun the witchs sight
before folks lest there misgiving
tis true she showed on saint andrews night
my future sweetheart just as he were living


the other

she showed mine in crystal clear
with several wild young blades a soldierlover
i seek him everywhere i pry and peer
and somehow his face i cant discover

soldiers

castles with lofty
ramparts and towers
maidens disdainful
in beautys array
both ours
bold is the venture
splendid the pay
lads the trumpets
for suing—
calling to pleasure
calling to ruin
stormy our life is
such is its boon
maidens and castles
capitulate soon
bold is the venture
splendid the pay
and the soldiers go marching
marching away


faust and wagner


faust

released from ice are brook and river
by the quickening glance of the gracious spring
the colors of hope to the valley cling
and weak old winter himself shiver
withdrawn to the mountains a crownless king
whence ever retreating he sends again
impotent showers of sleet that darkle
in belts across the green o the plain
but the sun will permit no white to sparkle
everywhere in development moveth
he will brighten the world with the tints he loveth
and lacking blossoms blue yellow and red
he takes these gaudy people instead
turn about and from this height
back on the town direct sight
out of the hollow gloomy gate
the motley throngs come forth elate
each will the joy of the sunshine hoard
to honor the day of the risen lord
they feel themselves their resurrection
from the low dark rooms scarce habitable
from the bonds of work from trades restriction
from the pressing weight of roof and gable
from the narrow crushing streets and alleys
from the churches solemn and reverend night
all come forth to the cheerful light
how lively see the multitude sallies
scattering through gardens and fields remote
while over the river that broadly dallies
dances so a festive boat
and overladen nigh to sinking
the last full wherry takes the stream
yonder afar from the hillpaths blinking
their clothes are colors that softly gleam
i hear the noise of the village
is the peoples proper heaven
high and low contented see
i am man—dare man to


wagner

to stroll with you sir doctor flatters
tis honor profit unto
but i alone shun these shallow matters
since all thats coarse provokes my enmity
this fiddling shouting tenpin rolling
i hate—these noises of the throng
they rave as satan were their sports controlling
and call mirth and call song


peasants under the lindentree


all for the dance the shepherd dressed
in ribbons wreath and gayest vest
himself with care arraying
around the linden lass and lad
already footed like mad
hurrah hurrah
hurrah—tararala
the fiddlebow was playing

he broke the ranks no whit afraid
and with his elbow punched a maid
who stood the dance surveying
the buxom wench she turned and said
you i call a stupidhead
hurrah hurrah
hurrah—tararala
decent while youre staying

round the circle went their flight
they danced to left they danced to right
their kirtles all were playing
they first grew red and grew warm
and rested panting arm in arm—
hurrah hurrah
hurrah—tararala
and hips and elbows straying

dont so familiar
how a has fooled his dear
waylaying and betraying

and he coaxed her soon aside
and round the linden sounded wide
hurrah hurrah
hurrah—tararala
and the fiddlebow was playing

old peasant

sir doctor is good of you
that you condescend today
among this crowd of merry folk
a highlylearned man to stray
also take the finest can
we fill with fresh wine for your sake
i offer and humbly wish
that not alone your thirst is slake—
that as the drops below its brink
so days of life you drink


faust

i take the cup you kindly reach
with thanks and health to all and each




old peasant

in truth tis and fitly timed
that our day of joy you share
who heretofore in evil days
gave so much of helping care
a man stands living
saved by your fathers skillful hand
that snatched him from the fevers rage
and stayed the plague in all the land
also you though but a youth
went into every house of pain
the corpses carried forth
but you in health came out again

faust

no test or trial you evaded
a helping god the helper aided

all

health to the man so skilled and tried
that for our help he long abide

faust

to him above bow down my friends
who teaches help and succor sends



wagner

with what a feeling great man
receive the peoples honest veneration
how lucky he whose gifts his station
with such advantages endow
thourt shown to all the younger generation
each asks and presses near to gaze
the fiddle stops the dance delays
goest they stand in rows to see
and all the caps are lifted high
a little more and they bend the knee
as if the holy host came by

faust

a few more steps ascend as far as yonder stone—
from our wandering will we rest contented
lost in thought ive lingered oft alone
when foolish fasts and prayers my life tormented
rich in hope and firm in faith
with tears wrung hands and sighs ive striven
the end of that farspreading death
entreating from the lord of heaven
like contempt the crowds applauses seem
couldst but read within mine inmost spirit
how little i deem
that sire or son such praises merit
my fathers was a sombre brooding brain
which through the holy spheres of nature groped and wandered
and honestly in his own fashion pondered
with labor whimsical and pain
who in his dusky workshop bending
with proved adepts in company
made from his recipes unending
opposing substances agree
there was a lion red a wooer daring
within the lilys tepid bath espoused
and both tormented by flame unsparing
by turns in either bridal chamber housed
if appeared with colors splendid
the young queen in her crystal shell
this was the medicine—the patients woes soon ended
and none demanded who got
we our hellish boluses compounding
among these vales and hills surrounding
worse than the pestilence have passed
thousands were done to death from poison of my giving
and i hear by all the living
the shameless murderers praised at last

wagner

why therefore yield to such depression
a good man does his honest share
in exercising with the strictest care
the bequeathed to his possession
father honor as a youth
his teaching cheerfully impel
as man increase the stores of truth
thine own son afterwards excel

faust

o happy he who renews
the hope from errors deeps to rise forever
that which does not know needs to use
and what knows uses never
but not by such despondence so
the fortune of this hour embitter
mark how beneath the evening sunlights glow
the greenembosomed houses glitter
the glow retreats done is the day of toil
yonder hastes new fields of life exploring
ah that no wing can lift from the soil
its track to follow follow soaring
i see eternal evening gild
the silent world beneath glowing
on fire each mountainpeak with peace each valley filled
the silver brook to golden rivers flowing
the mountainchain with all its gorges deep
no more impede my godlike motion
and before mine eyes expands the ocean
with all its bays in shining sleep
finally the weary god is sinking
the newborn impulse fires my mind—
i hasten on his beams eternal drinking
the day before and the night behind
above heaven unfurled the floor of waves beneath me—
a glorious dream though the glories fade
alas the wings that lift the mind no aid
of wings to lift the body can bequeath
in each soul is born the pleasure
of yearning onward upward and away
when oer our heads lost in the vaulted azure
the lark sends down his flickering lay—
when over crags and piny highlands
the poising eagle slowly soars
and over plains and lakes and islands
the crane sails by to other shores

wagner

ive had myself at times some odd caprices
but never such impulse felt as this is
soon fatigues on woods and fields to look
nor i beg the bird his wing to spare
how otherwise the mental raptures bear
from page to page from book to book
winter nights take loveliness untold
as warmer life in every limb had crowned you
and when your hands unroll some parchment rare and old
all heaven descends and opens bright around you

faust

impulse conscious of at best
o never seek to know the other
two souls alas reside within my breast
and each withdraws from and repels its brother
with tenacious organs holds in love
and clinging lust the world in its embraces
the other strongly sweeps this dust above
into the high ancestral spaces
if there airy spirits near
twixt heaven and earth on potent errands fleeing
them drop down the golden atmosphere
and bear forth to new and varied being
yea if a magic mantle once were mine
to waft oer the world at pleasure
i not for the costliest stores of treasure—
not for a monarchs robe—the gift resign

wagner

invoke not the wellknown throng
which through the firmament diffused is faring
and danger thousandfold our race to wrong
in every quarter is preparing
swift from the north the spiritfangs so sharp
sweep down and with their barbéd points assail you
from the east they come to dry and warp
your lungs till breath and being fail you
if from the desert sendeth them the south
with fire on fire your throbbing forehead crowning
the west leads on a host to cure the drouth
only when meadow field and you are drowning
they gladly hearken prompt for injury—
gladly obey because they gladly cheat
from heaven they represent themselves to
and lisp like angels when with lies they meet
but go tis gray and dusky all
the air is cold the vapors fall
at night learns his house to prize—
why stand you with such astonished eyes
what in the twilight can your mind so trouble

faust

seest the black dog coursing there through corn and
stubble

wagner

long since deemed him not important in the least

faust

inspect him close for what takst the beast

wagner

why for a poodle who has lost his master
and scents about his track to find

faust

seest the spiral circles narrowing faster
which he approaching round seems to wind
a streaming trail of fire if i see rightly
follows his path of mystery

wagner

that your eyes deceive you slightly
naught but a plain black poodle do i see

faust

seems to that with enchanted cunning
he snares our feet some future chain to bind

wagner

i see him timidly in doubt around running
since in his masters stead two strangers he find

faust

the circle narrows he is near

wagner

a dog seest and not a phantom
behold him stop—upon his belly crawl—his
tail set wagging canine habits all

faust

come follow come at least

wagner

tis the absurdest drollest beast
stand and you will see him wait
address him and he gambols straight
if somethings lost hell quickly bring it—
your cane if in the stream you fling

faust

no doubt youre right no trace of mind i own
is in the beast i see but drill alone

wagner

the dog when hes educated
is by the wisest tolerated
yes he deserves your favor thoroughly—
the clever scholar of the students he

the study

faust



behind field and meadow sleeping
i leave in deep prophetic night
within whose dread and holy keeping
the better soul awakes to light
the wild desires no longer win
the deeds of passion cease to chain
the love of man revives within
the love of god revives again

poodle make not such racket and riot
why at the threshold wilt snuffing
behind the stove repose in quiet
my softest cushion i give to
as up yonder with running and leaping
amused on the mountains crest

so i take into my keeping
a welcome but also a silent guest

ah when within our narrow chamber
the lamp with friendly lustre glows
flames in the breast each faded ember
and in the heart itself that knows
hope again lends sweet assistance
and reason resumes her speech
yearns the rivers of existence
the very founts of life to reach

snarl not poodle to the sound that rises
the sacred tones that my soul embrace
this bestial noise is out of place
we are used to see that man despises
what he never comprehends
and the good and the beautiful vilipends
finding them often hard to measure
will the dog like man snarl his displeasure

but ah i feel though will thereto stronger
contentment flows from out my breast no longer
why the stream so soon run dry and fail
and burning thirst again assail
therein ive borne so much probation
and this want supplied
we call the supernatural to guide
we pine and thirst for revelation
which nowhere worthier is more nobly sent
than in our new testament
i feel impelled its meaning to determine—
with honest purpose once for all
the hallowed
to change to my beloved german


tis written in the beginning was the word
am i balked who can help afford
the word—impossible so high to rate
and otherwise i translate
if by the spirit i am truly taught
in the beginning was the thought
this first line weigh completely
lest my impatient pen proceed too fleetly
is the thought which works creates indeed
in the beginning was the power i read
as i write a warning is suggested
that i the sense not have fairly tested
the spirit aids i see the light
in the beginning was the act i write

if i share my chamber with
poodle stop that howling prithee
cease to bark and bellow
such a noisy disturbing fellow
ill no longer suffer near
of hear
leave i fear
no longer guestright i bestow
the door is open free to go
but what do i see in the creature
is that in the course of nature
ist actual fact or fancys shows
how long and broad my poodle grows
he rises mightily
a canine that cannot
what a spectre ive harbored
he resembles a hippopotamus
with fiery eyes teeth terrible to see
o am i sure of
for all of halfhellish brood
the key of solomon is good

spirits

some within is caught
stay without follow him not
like the fox in a snare
quakes the old helllynx there
take heed—look about
back and forth hover
under and over
and hell work himself out
if your aid avail him
not fail him
for he without measure
has wrought for our pleasure

faust

first to encounter the beast
the words of the four addressed
salamander shine glorious
wave undine as bidden
sylph hidden
gnome laborious

who knows not their sense
—
their properties
and power not sees—
no mastery he inherits
over the spirits

vanish in flaming ether
salamander
flow foamingly together
undine
shine in meteorsheen
sylph
bring help to hearth and shelf
incubus incubus
step forward and finish

of the four no feature
lurks in the creature
quiet he lies and grins disdain
not seems have i given him pain
to undisguise
hear exorcise
my gay
hells fugitive strayone
the sign witness
before which they bow
the cohorts of hell

with hair all bristling begins to swell

base being hearest
knowest and fearest
the unoriginate
named inexpressibly
through all heaven impermeate
pierced irredressibly

behind the stove banned
see an elephant expand
fills the space entire
mistlike melting ever faster
tis enough ascend no higher—
lay thyself at the feet of the master
seest not vain the threats i bring
with holy fire ill scorch and sting
wait not to know
the threefold dazzling glow
wait not to know
the strongest within my hands

mephistopheles

while the vapor is dissipating steps forth from behind the
stove in the costume of a travelling scholar
why such a noise what are my lords commands

faust

this was the poodles real core
a travelling scholar the casus is diverting

mephistopheles

the learned gentleman i bow before
youve made roundly sweat thats certain

faust

what is name

mephistopheles

a question small seems
for whose mind the word so much despises
who scorning all external gleams
the depths of being only prizes

faust

with all you gentlemen the names a test
whereby the nature usually is expressed
clearly the latter implies
in names like beelzebub destroyer father of lies
who

mephistopheles

part of that power not understood
which always wills the bad and always works the good

faust

what hidden sense in this enigma lies

mephistopheles

i am the spirit that denies
and justly so for all things from the void
called forth deserve to destroyed
twere better were naught created
all which you as sin have rated—
destruction—aught with evil blent—
that is my proper element

faust

namst thyself a part showst complete to

mephistopheles

the modest truth i speak to
if man that microcosmic fool can see
himself a whole so frequently
part of the part am i once all in primal night—
part of the darkness which brought forth the light
the haughty light which disputes the space
and claims of mother night her ancient place
and the struggle fails since light howeer weaves
fettered unto bodies cleaves
flows from bodies bodies beautifies
by bodies is its course impeded
and so but little time is needed
i hope ere as the bodies die dies

faust

i see the plan pursuing
canst not compass general ruin
and on smaller scale begun

mephistopheles

and truly tis not much when all is done
that which to naught is in resistance set—
the something of this clumsy world—has
with all that i have undertaken
not been by disturbed or shaken
from earthquake tempest wave volcanos brand
back into quiet settle sea and land
and that damned stuff the bestial human brood—
what use in having that to play with
how have i made away with
and ever circulates a newer fresher blood
makes furious such things beholding
from water earth and air unfolding
a thousand germs break forth and grow
in dry and wet and warm and chilly
and had i not the flame reserved why really
theres nothing special of my own to show

faust

so to the actively eternal
creative force in cold disdain
you oppose the fist infernal
whose wicked clench is all in vain
some other labor seek rather
queer son of chaos to begin

mephistopheles

consider canst gather
my views when next i venture in
might i perhaps depart at present

faust

why shouldst ask i dont perceive
though our acquaintance is so recent
for further visits leave
the windows the door is yonder
a chimney also you behold

mephistopheles

i confess that forth i not wander
my steps by slight obstacle controlled—
the wizardsfoot that on your threshold made is

faust

the pentagram prohibits
why tell son of hades
if that prevents how camst in to
could such a spirit so cheated

mephistopheles

inspect the thing the drawings not completed
the outer angle you see
is open left—the lines dont fit

faust

well—chance this time has fairly hit
and thourt prisoner to
seems the business has succeeded

mephistopheles

the poodle naught remarked as after he speeded
but other aspects obtain
the devil cant get out again

faust

try the open windowpane

mephistopheles

for devils and for spectres this is law
where they have entered in there also they withdraw
the first is free to were governed by the second

faust

in hell itself laws are reckoned
thats so might a compact
made with you gentlemen—and binding—surely

mephistopheles

all that is promised delight purely
no skinflint bargain see
but this is not of swift conclusion
talk about the matter soon
and i do entreat this boon—
leave to withdraw from my intrusion

faust

moment more i ask to remain
some pleasant news at least to tell

mephistopheles

release i soon come again
at will mayst question and compel

faust

i have not snares around cast
thyself led thyself into the meshes
who traps the devil hold him fast
not soon a second time hell catch a prey so precious

mephistopheles

ant please also im content to stay
and serve in a social station
but stipulating that i
with arts of mine afford recreation

faust

thereto i willingly agree
if the diversion pleasant

mephistopheles

my friend thoult win past all pretences
more in this hour to soothe senses
than in the years monotony
that which the dainty spirits sing
the lovely pictures they bring
are more than magics empty show
scent will to bliss invited
palate with taste delighted
nerves of touch ecstatic glow
all unprepared the charm i spin
were together so begin

spirits

vanish darking
arches above him
loveliest weather
born of blue ether
break from the sky
o that the darkling
clouds had departed
starlight is sparkling
tranquillerhearted
suns are on high
heavens own children
in beauty bewildering
waveringly bending
pass as they hover
longing unending
follows them over
they with their glowing
garments outflowing
cover in going
landscape and bower
where in seclusion
lovers are plighted
lost in illusion
bower on bower
tendrils unblighted
lo in a shower
grapes that oercluster
gush into or
flow into rivers
of foaming and flashing
wine that is dashing
gems as boundeth
down the high places
and spreading surroundeth
with crystalline spaces
in happy embraces
blossoming forelands
emerald shorelands
and the winged races
drink and fly onward—
fly ever sunward
to the enticing
islands that flatter
dipping and rising
light on the water
hark the inspiring
sound of their quiring
see the entrancing
whirl of their dancing
all in the air are
freer and fairer
some of them scaling
boldly the highlands
others are sailing
circling the islands
others are flying
lifeward all hieing—
all for the distant
star of existent
rapture and love

mephistopheles

he sleeps enough fays your airy number
have sung him truly into slumber
for this performance i your debtor prove—
not the man to catch the fiend and hold him—
with fairest images of dreams infold him
plunge him in seas of sweet untruth
for the thresholds magic which controlled him
the devil needs a rats quick tooth
i use no lengthened invocation
rustles that soon will work my liberation

the lord of rats and eke of mice
of flies and bedbugs frogs and lice
summons hither to the doorsill
to gnaw where with just a morsel
of oil he paints the spot for thee—
there comst hopping on to
to work at once the point which made craven
is forward on the ledge engraven
another bite makes free the door
so dream dreams o faust until we meet once more

faust

am i again so foully cheated
remains there naught of lofty spiritsway
but that a dream the devil counterfeited
and that a poodle ran away

mephistopheles

tis i

faust

come in

mephistopheles

thrice the words spoken

faust

come in


mephistopheles

pleasest
i hope suit each other
for vapors to dispel
i come a squire of high degree
in scarlet coat with golden trimming
a cloak in silken lustre swimming
a tall cocksfeather in my hat
a long sharp sword for show or quarrel—
and i advise brief and flat
to don the selfsame gay apparel
that from this den released and free
life at last revealed to

faust

this life of earth whatever my attire
pain in its wonted fashion
too old am i to play with passion
too young to without desire
what from the world have i to gain
abstain—renounce—refrain
such is the everlasting song
that in the ears of all men rings—
that unrelieved our whole life long
each hour in passing hoarsely sings
in very terror i at morn awake
the verge of bitter weeping
to see the day of disappointment break
to no hope of mine—not one—its promise keeping—
that each joys presentiment
with wilful cavil diminish
with grinning masks of life prevent
my mind its fairest work to finish
too when night descends how anxiously
my couch of sleep i lay
there also comes no rest to
but some wild dream is sent to fray
the god that in my breast is owned
can deeply stir the inner sources
the god above my powers enthroned
he cannot change external forces
so by the burden of my days oppressed
death is desired and life a thing unblest

mephistopheles

and is never death a wholly welcome guest

faust

o fortunate for whom when victory glances
the bloody laurels on the brow he bindeth
whom after rapid maddening dances
in clasping maidenarms he findeth
o that i before that spiritpower
ravished and rapt from life had sunken

mephistopheles

and by some in that nightly hour
a certain liquid was not drunken

faust

eavesdropping ha pleasure seems to

mephistopheles

omniscient am i not much is known to

faust

though some familiar tone retrieving
my thoughts from torment led on
and sweet clear echoes came deceiving
a faith bequeathed from childhoods dawn
i curse whateer entices
and snares the soul with visions vain
with dazzling cheats and dear devices
confines in this cave of pain
cursed at once the high ambition
wherewith the mind itself deludes
cursed the glare of apparition
that on the finer sense intrudes
cursed the lying dreams impression
of name and fame and laurelled brow
cursed all that flatters as possession
as wife and child as knave and plow
cursed mammon when he with treasures
to restless action spurs our fate
cursed when for soft indulgent leisures
he lays for the pillows straight
cursed the vines transcendent nectar—
the highest favor love lets fall
cursed also hope—cursed faith the spectre
and cursed patience most of all

chorus of spirits

woe woe
destroyed
the beautiful world
with powerful fist
in ruin tis hurled
by the blow of a demigod shattered
the scattered
fragments into the void we carry
deploring
the beauty perished beyond restoring
mightier
for the children of men
brightlier
build again
in thine own bosom build anew
bid the new career
commence
with clearer sense
and the new songs of cheer
sung thereto

mephistopheles

these are the small dependants
who give attendance
hear them to deeds and passion
counsel in shrewd oldfashion
into the world of strife
out of this lonely life
that of senses and sap has betrayed
they persuade
this nursing of the pain forego
that like a vulture feeds breast
the worst society findst will show
a man among the rest
but tis not meant to thrust
into the mob hatest
i am not of the greatest
wilt to entrust
steps through life ill guide thee—
will willingly walk beside thee—
will serve at once and forever
with best endeavor
and if satisfied
will as servant slave with abide

faust

and what my counterservice therefor

mephistopheles

the time is long needst not insist

faust

no—no the devil is an egotist
and is not apt without a why or
for gods sake others to assist
speak conditions plain and clear
with such a servant danger comes i fear

mephistopheles

an unwearied slave ill wear tether
and to thine every nod obedient
when there again we come together
do the same for

faust

the there my scruples naught increases
when dashed this world to pieces
the other its place fill
on this earth my pleasures have their sources
yon sun beholds my sorrows in his courses
and when from these my life itself divorces
happen all that can or will
ill hear no more tis vain to ponder
if there we cherish love or hate
or in the spheres we dream of yonder
a high and low our souls await

mephistopheles

in this sense canst venture
come bind thyself by prompt indenture
and mine arts with joy see
what no man ever saw ill give to

faust

canst poor devil give whatsoever
when was a human soul in its supreme endeavor
eer understood by such as
food which never satiates now—
the restless ruddy gold
that runs quicksilverlike ones fingers through—
a game whose winnings no man ever knew—
a maid that from my breast
beckons my neighbor with her wanton glances
and honors godlike zest
the meteor that a moment dances—
show the fruits that ere theyre gathered rot
and trees that daily with new leafage clothe them

mephistopheles

such a demand alarms not
such treasures have i and can show them
but the time reach good my friend
when peace we crave and more luxurious diet

faust

when on an idlers bed i stretch myself in quiet
there at once my record end
canst with lying flattery rule
until selfpleased myself i see—
canst with rich enjoyment fool
that day the last for
the bet i offer

mephistopheles
done

faust
and heartily
when i hail the moment flying
ah delay—thou so fair
bind in bonds undying
my final ruin declare
the deathbell chime the token
from service free
the clock stop the hand broken
time finished unto

mephistopheles

consider my memory good is rated

faust

a perfect right thereto
my powers i have not rashly estimated
a slave am i whateer i do—
if thine or whose tis needless to debate

mephistopheles

at the doctorsbanquet i today
will as a servant wait behind
but thing more beyond all risk to bind
give a line or two i pray

faust

demandst pedant too a document
never known a man nor proved his words intent
ist not enough that what i speak today
stand with all my future days agreeing
in all its tides sweeps not the world away
and a promise bind my being
this delusion in our hearts we bear
who himself therefrom deliver
blest he whose bosom truth makes pure and fair
no sacrifice he repent of ever
nathless a parchment writ and stamped with care
a spectre is which all to shun endeavor
the word alas dies in the pen
and wax and leather keep the lordship
what wilt from base spirit say—
brass marble parchment paper clay
the terms with graver quill or chisel stated
i freely leave the choice to

mephistopheles

why heat thyself instantly
with eloquence exaggerated
each leaf for such a pact is good
and to subscribe name thoult take a drop of blood

faust

if therewith fully satisfied
so by the farce abide

mephistopheles

blood is a juice of rarest quality

faust

fear not that i this pact seek to sever
the promise that i make to
is just the sum of my endeavor
i have myself inflated all too high
my proper place is estate
the mighty spirit deigns no reply
and nature shuts on her gate
the thread of thought at last is broken
and knowledge brings disgust unspoken
the sensual deeps explore
to quench the fervors of glowing passion
every marvel take and fashion
through the impervious veil wore
plunge we in times tumultuous dance
in the rush and roll of circumstance
delight and distress
and worry and success
alternately follow as best they can
restless activity proves the man

mephistopheles

for you no bound no term is set
whether you everywhere trying
or snatch a rapid bliss in flying
agree with you what you get
only fall to and show no timid balking

faust

but heard tis not of joy were talking
i take the wildering whirl enjoyments keenest pain
enamored hate exhilarant disdain
my bosom of its thirst for knowledge sated
not henceforth from any pang wrested
and all of life for all mankind created
within mine inmost being tested
the highest lowest forms my soul borrow
heap itself their bliss and sorrow
and my own sole self to all their selves expanded
i too at last with them all stranded

mephistopheles

believe who for a thousand year
the same tough meat have chewed and tested
that from the cradle to the bier
no man the ancient leaven has digested
trust of this whole supernal
is made but for a gods delight
he dwells in splendor single and eternal
but he thrusts in darkness out of sight
and you he dowers with day and night

faust

nay but i will

mephistopheles

a good reply
only fear needs repeating
the is long the time is fleeting
thyself taught say i
go league thyself with a poet
give the rein to his imagination
wear the crown and show
of the qualities of his creation—
the courage of the lions breed
the wild stags speed
the italians fiery blood
the norths firm fortitude
him find for the secret tether
that binds the noble and mean together
and teach pulses of youth and pleasure
to love by rule and hate by measure
id like myself such a to see
sir microcosm his name should

faust

what am i if tis denied my part
the crown of all humanity to win
whereto yearns every sense within

mephistopheles

why on the whole thourt—what
set wigs of million curls head to raise
wear shoes an ell in height—the truth betrays
and remainest—what

faust

i feel indeed that i have made the treasure
of human thought and knowledge mine in vain
and if i sit down in restful leisure
no fount of newer strength is in my brain
i am no hairsbreadth more in height
nor nearer to the infinite

mephistopheles

good sir you see the facts precisely
as they are seen by each and all
we arrange them more wisely
before the joys of life pall
why zounds both hands and feet are truly—
and head and virile forces—thine
all that i indulge in newly
ist thence less wholly mine
if ive six stallions in my stall
are not their forces also lent
i speed along completest man of all
as though my legs were fourandtwenty
take hold reflection rest
and plunge into the world with zest
i say to a speculative wight
is like a beast on moorlands lean
that round and round some fiend misleads to evil plight
while all about lie pastures fresh and green

faust

how we begin

mephistopheles

try a wider sphere
what place of martyrdom is
ist life i ask ist prudence
to bore thyself and bore the students
neighbor paunch to that attend
why plague thyself with threshing straw forever
the best learnest in the end
darst not tell the youngsters—never
i hear ones footsteps hither steering

faust
to see him i have no heart

mephistopheles

so long the poor boy waits a hearing
he not unconsoled depart
cap and mantle straightway lend
ill play the comedy with



my wits certain will befriend
but fifteen minutes time is all i need
for our fine trip meanwhile prepare thyself with speed

exit faust

mephistopheles



reason and knowledge only despise
the highest strength in man that lies
but the lying spirit bind
with magic works and shows that blind
and i have fast and sure—
fate such a bold untrammelled spirit gave him
as forwards onwards ever endure
whose overhasty impulse drave him
past earthly joys he might secure
dragged through the wildest life will i enslave him
through flat and stale indifference
with struggling chilling checking so deprave him
that to his hot insatiate sense
the dream of drink mock but never lave him
refreshment his lips in vain implore—
had he not made himself the devils naught could save
him
were he lost forevermore



student

a short time only am i
and come devoted and sincere
to greet and know the man of fame
whom men to with reverence name

mephistopheles

your courtesy flatter
you see a man as others
have you perchance elsewhere begun

student

receive i pray as
who comes to you with courage good
somewhat of cash and healthy blood
my mother was hardly willing to
but knowledge worth having i fain get

mephistopheles

you have reached the right place

student

id like to leave i avow
i find these walls these vaulted spaces
are anything but pleasant places
tis all so cramped and close and mean
sees no tree no glimpse of green
and when the lecturehalls receive
seeing hearing and thinking leave

mephistopheles

all that depends on habitude
so from its mothers breasts a child
at first reluctant takes its food
but soon to seek them is beguiled
at the breasts of wisdom clinging
thoult find each day a greater rapture bringing

student

ill hang thereon with joy and freely drain them
but tell pray the proper means to gain them

mephistopheles

explain before you further speak
the special faculty you seek

student

i crave the highest erudition
and fain make my acquisition
all that there is in earth and heaven
in nature and in science too

mephistopheles

is the genuine path for you
strict attention given

student

body and soul thereon ill wreak
truly ive some inclination
on summer holidays to seek
a little freedom and recreation

mephistopheles

use your time flies so swiftly from
but time through order won i promise
so friend
first the collegium logicum
there will your mind drilled and braced
as if in spanish boots twere laced
and to graver paces brought
twill plod along the path of thought
instead of shooting and there
a willothewisp in murky air
days will spent to bid you know
what once you did at a single blow
like eating and drinking free and strong—
that two three thereto belong
truly the fabric of mental fleece
resembles a weavers masterpiece
where a thousand threads treadle throws
where fly the shuttles hither and thither
unseen the threads are knit together
and an infinite combination grows
the philosopher steps in
and shows no otherwise could have been
the first was so the second so
therefore the third and fourth are so
were not the first and second
the third and fourth had never been
the scholars are everywhere believers
but never succeed in being weavers
he who study organic existence
first drives out the soul with rigid persistence
the parts in his hand he hold and class
but the spiritual link is lost alas
encheiresin natures this chemistry names
nor knows how herself she banters and blames

student

i cannot understand you quite

mephistopheles

your mind will shortly set aright
when you have learned all things reducing
to classify them for your using

student

i feel as stupid from all youve said
as if a millwheel whirled in my head

mephistopheles

and after—first and foremost duty—of
metaphysics learn the use and beauty
see that you most profoundly gain
what does not suit the human brain
a splendid word to serve youll find
for what goes in—or wont go in—your mind
but first at least this half a year
to order rigidly adhere
five hours a day you understand
and when the clock strikes on hand
prepare beforehand for your part
with paragraphs all got by heart
so you can better watch and look
that naught is said but what is in the book
in writing as unwearied
as did the holy ghost dictate to

student

no need to tell twice to do
i think how useful tis to write
for what has in black and white
carries home and goes through

mephistopheles

choose thyself a faculty

student

i cannot reconcile myself to jurisprudence

mephistopheles

nor can i therefore greatly blame you students
i know what science this has come to
all rights and laws are transmitted
like an eternal sickness of the race—
from generation unto generation fitted
and shifted round from place to place
reason becomes a sham beneficence a worry
a grandchild therefore woe to
the right born with ours in verity
this to consider theres alas no hurry

student

my own disgust is strengthened by your speech
o lucky he whom you teach
ive almost for theology decided

mephistopheles

i should not wish to see you misguided
for as regards this science hint
tis very hard to shun the false direction
theres so much secret poison lurking in t
so like the medicine baffles your detection
hear therefore alone for that is best in sooth
and simply take your masters words for truth
on words your attention centre
through the safest gate youll enter
the templehalls of certainty

student

in the word some idea

mephistopheles

of course but only shun too oversharp a tension
for just where fails the comprehension
a word steps promptly in as deputy
with words tis excellent disputing
systems to words tis easy suiting
on words tis excellent believing
no word can ever lose a jot from thieving

student

pardon with questions i detain you
i trouble you again
of medicine i fain
hear strong word that might explain you
three years is but a little space
and god who can the field embrace
if some index could shown
twere easier groping forward truly

mephistopheles

im tired enough of this dry tone—
play the devil again and fully



to grasp the spirit of medicine is easy
learn of the great and little world your fill
to go at last so please
just as god will
in vain that through the realms of science you drift
each learns only—just what learn he can
he who grasps the moments gift
he is the proper man
wellmade you are tis not to denied
the rest a bold address will win you
if you but in yourself confide
at once confide all others in you
to lead the women learn the special feeling
their everlasting aches and groans
in thousand tones
have all source mode of healing
and if your acts are half discreet
youll always have them at your feet
a title first draw and interest them
and show that yours all other arts exceeds
as a greeting you are free to touch and test them
while to do for years another pleads
you press and count the pulses dances
and with burning sidelong glances
you clasp the swelling hips to see
if tightly laced her corsets

student

thats better the how and where sees

mephistopheles

my worthy friend gray are all theories
and green alone lifes golden tree

student

i swear to you tis like a dream to
might i again presume with trust unbounded
to hear your wisdom thoroughly expounded

mephistopheles

most willingly to what extent i

student

i cannot really go away
allow that my album first i reach you—
grant this favor i beseech you

mephistopheles

assuredly



student

eritis sicut deus scientes bonum et malum


mephistopheles

follow the ancient text and the snake wast ordered to trample
with all likeness to god thoult a sorry example



faust

whither we go

mephistopheles

as best pleases
the little world and the great see
with what delight what profit winning
sponge through the term beginning

faust

with the flowing beard i wear
both ease and grace will fail there
the attempt indeed were a futile strife
i never could learn the ways of life
i feel so small before others and thence
should always find embarrassments

mephistopheles

my friend soon lose all such misgiving
but selfpossessed the of living

faust

how we leave the house and start
where servant coach and horses

mephistopheles

spread this cloak with proper
through the air direct our courses
but only on so bold a flight
sure to have luggage light
a little burning air which i soon prepare
above the earth will nimbly bear
and if were light travel swift and clear
i gratulate on new career

auerbachs cellar in leipzig
carousal of jolly companions

frosch

ill teach you how to grin im thinking
today youre like wet straw so tame
and usually youre all aflame

brander

thats your fault from you we nothing see
no beastliness and no stupidity

frosch


theres both together

brander

twice a swine

frosch

you wanted them ive given you mine

siebel

turn out who quarrels—out the door
with open throat sing chorus drink and roar
up holla ho

altmayer

woes the fearful bellow
bring cotton quick hes split my ears that fellow

siebel

when the vault echoes to the song
first perceives the bass is deep and strong

frosch

said and out with him that takes the least offence
ah tara lara da

altmayer

ah tara lara da

frosch

the throats are tuned commence

the dear old holy roman realm
how does hold together

brander

a nasty song fie a political song—
a most offensive song thank god each morning therefore
that you have not the roman realm to care for
at least i hold so much gain for
that i nor chancellor nor kaiser
also we have a ruling head i hope
and so choose ourselves a pope
you know the quality that can
decide the choice and elevate the man

frosch

soar up soar up dame nightingale
ten thousand times my sweetheart hail

siebel

no greet my sweetheart not i tell you ill resent

frosch

my sweetheart greet and kiss i dare you to prevent



draw the latch the darkness makes
draw the latch the lover wakes
shut the latch the morning breaks

siebel

yes sing away sing on and praise and brag of her
ill wait my proper time for laughter
by the nose she led and shell lead you after
her paramour should an ugly gnome
where four roads cross in wanton play to meet her
an old hegoat from blocksberg coming home
should his goodnight in lustful gallop bleat her
a fellow made of genuine flesh and blood
is for the wench a deal too good
greet her not i unless when meeting
to smash her windows a greeting

brander

attention hearken to
confess sirs i know how to live
enamored persons have we
and i as suits their quality
something fresh for their advantage give
take heed tis of the latest cut my strain
and all strike in at each refrain



there was a rat in the cellarnest
whom fat and butter made smoother
he had a paunch beneath his vest
like that of doctor luther
the cook laid poison cunningly
and as sore oppressed was he
as if he had love in his bosom

chorus

as if he had love in his bosom

brander

he ran around he ran about
his thirst in puddles laving
he gnawed and scratched the house throughout
but nothing cured his raving
he whirled and jumped with torment mad
and soon enough the poor beast had
as if he had love in his bosom

chorus

as if he had love in his bosom

brander

and driven at last in open day
he ran into the kitchen
fell on the hearth and squirming lay
in the last convulsion twitching
laughed the murderess in her glee
ha ha hes at his last gasp said she
as if he had love in his bosom

chorus

as if he had love in his bosom

siebel

how the dull fools enjoy the matter
to is a proper
poison for such poor rats to scatter

brander

perhaps youll warmly take their part

altmayer

the baldpate potbelly i have noted
misfortune tames him by degrees
for in the rat by poison bloated
his own most natural he sees

faust and mephistopheles

mephistopheles

before all else i bring hither
where boon companions meet together
to see how smooth life runs away
for the folk each days a holiday
with little wit and ease to suit them
they whirl in narrow circling trails
like kittens playing with their tails
and if no headache persecute them
so long the host credit give
they merrily and careless live

brander

the fact is easy to unravel
their airs so odd theyve just returned from travel
a single hour theyve not been

frosch

youve verily hit the truth leipzig to is dear
paris in miniature how refines its people

siebel

who are the strangers should you guess

frosch

alone ill set them first to drinking
and as a childs tooth draws with cleverness
ill worm their secret out im thinking
theyre of a noble house thats very clear
haughty and discontented they appear

brander

theyre mountebanks a revel

altmayer

perhaps

frosch

look out ill smoke them

mephistopheles

not if he had them by the neck i vow
eer these people scent the devil

faust
fair greeting gentlemen

siebel

our thanks we give the same

in foot is the fellow lame

mephistopheles

is permitted that we share your leisure
in place of cheering drink which seeks vainly
your company give pleasure

altmayer

a most fastidious person you appear


frosch

no doubt twas late when you from rippach started
and supping there with hans occasioned your delay

mephistopheles

we passed without a call today
at our last interview before we parted
much of his cousins did he speak entreating
that we should give to each his kindly greeting



altmayer

you have he understands

siebel

a knave sharpset

frosch

just wait awhile ill have him

mephistopheles

if i am right we heard the sound
of welltrained voices singing chorus
and truly song rebound
superbly from the arches oer

frosch

are you perhaps a virtuoso

mephistopheles

o no my wish is great my power is only soso

altmayer

give a song

mephistopheles

if you desire a number

siebel

so that a brannew strain

mephistopheles

weve just retraced our way from spain
the lovely land of wine and song and slumber



there was a king once reigning
who had a big black flea—

frosch

hear hear a flea dye rightly take the jest
i call a flea a tidy guest

mephistopheles

there was a king once reigning
who had a big black flea
and loved him past explaining
as his own son were he
he called his man of stitches
the tailor came straightway
measure the lad for breeches
and measure his coat i say

brander

but mind allow the tailor no caprices
enjoin him as his head is dear
to most exactly measure sew and shear
so that the breeches have no creases

mephistopheles

in silk and velvet gleaming
he was wholly drest—
had a coat with ribbons streaming
a cross his breast
he had the first of stations
a ministers star and name
and also all his relations
great lords at court became

and the lords and ladies of honor
were plagued awake and in bed
the queen she got them her
the maids were bitten and bled
and they did not dare to brush them
or scratch them day or night
we crack them and we crush them
at once wheneer they bite

chorus

we crack them and we crush them
at once wheneer they bite

frosch
bravo bravo that was fine

siebel

every flea so befall

brander

point your fingers and nip them all

altmayer

hurrah for freedom hurrah for wine

mephistopheles

i fain drink with you my glass to freedom clinking
if twere a better wine that i see you drinking

siebel

dont hear that speech again

mephistopheles

did i not fear the landlord might complain
id treat these worthy guests with pleasure
to some from out our cellars treasure

siebel

just treat and the landlord arraign

frosch

and if the wine good our praises ample
but do not give too very small a sample
for if its quality i decide
with a good mouthful i supplied

altmayer

theyre from the rhine i guessed as much before

mephistopheles

bring a gimlet

brander

what therewith done
youve not the casks already at the door

altmayer

yonder within the landlords box of tools theres

mephistopheles



give of your taste some intimation

frosch

how do you mean have you so kinds

mephistopheles

the choice is free make up your minds

altmayer

aha you lick your chops from sheer anticipation

frosch

good if i have the choice so the wine rhenish
our fatherland can best the sparkling cup replenish

mephistopheles

boring a hole in the edge of the table at the place where
frosch sits

get a little wax to make the stoppers quick

altmayer

ah i perceive a jugglers trick

mephistopheles

and you

brander

mephistopheles

bores in the meantime has made the wax stoppers and
plugged the holes with them

brander

whats foreign cant always keep quite clear of
for good things oft are not so near
a german cant endure the french to see or hear of
drinks their wines with hearty cheer

siebel


for i grant sour wine is out of place
fill up my glass with sweetest will you

mephistopheles

tokay flow at once to fill you

altmayer

no—look sirs straight in the face
i see you have your fun at our expense

mephistopheles

o no with gentlemen of such pretence
that were to venture far indeed
speak out and make your choice with speed
with what a vintage can i serve you

altmayer

with any—only satisfy our need



mephistopheles

grapes the vinestem bears
horns the hegoat wears
the grapes are juicy the vines are wood
the wooden table gives wine as good
into the depths of nature peer—
only believe theres a miracle

draw the stoppers and drink your fill

all

as they draw out the stoppers and the wine which has been
desired flows into the glass of each

o beautiful fountain that flows at will

mephistopheles

but have a care that you nothing spill



all

as twere five hundred hogs we feel
so cannibalic jolly

mephistopheles

see the race is happy—it is free

faust

to leave them is my inclination

mephistopheles

take notice first their bestiality
will make a brilliant demonstration

siebel

drinks carelessly the wine spills the earth and turns to
flame

help fire help hellfire is sent

mephistopheles

quiet friendly element



a bit of purgatory twas for this time merely

siebel

what mean you wait—youll pay fort dearly
youll know to your detriment

frosch

dont try that game a second time

altmayer

i think wed better send him packing quietly

siebel

and play your hocuspocus on

mephistopheles

old winetub

siebel

brander

altmayer

siebel

altmayer

frosch

siebel

and purple grapes at hand

brander

over this green arbor bending
see what a vine what grapes depending

he takes siebel by the nose the others do the same reciprocally
and raise their knives

mephistopheles

loose error from their eyes the band
and how the devil jests enlightened



siebel

what happened

altmayer

frosch

brander

and yours that i have in hand

altmayer

frosch

altmayer

i saw him with these eyes a winecask riding
out of the cellardoor just
in my feet the fright like lead is weighing

why if the fount of wine should playing

siebel

twas all deceit and lying false design

frosch

and seemed as i were drinking wine

brander

but with the grapes how was pray

altmayer

believe no miracles just say

witches kitchen

a low hearth stands a great caldron under which a fire
is burning various figures appear in the vapors which
rise from the caldron an ape sits beside skims and
watches lest boil over the heape with the young
ones sits near and warms himself ceiling and walls are
covered with the most fantastic witchimplements

faust mephistopheles

faust

these crazy signs of witches craft repel
i recover tell
through this insane chaotic play
from an old hag i demand assistance
and will her foul mess take away
full thirty years from my existence
woes canst naught better find
another baffled hope lamented
has nature and has a noble mind
not any potent balsam invented

mephistopheles

once more my friend talkest sensibly
there is to make young a simpler mode and apter
but in another book tis writ for
and is a most eccentric chapter

faust

will i know

mephistopheles

good the method is revealed
without or gold or magic or physician
betake thyself to yonder field
there hoe and dig as condition
restrain thyself sense and will
within a narrow sphere to flourish
with unmixed food body nourish
live with the ox as ox and think not a theft
that manurst the acre which reapest—
that trust is the best mode left
whereby for eighty years youth keepest

faust

i am not used to that i cannot stoop to try it—
to take the spade in hand and ply
the narrow being suits not at all

mephistopheles

to thine aid the witch call

faust

the hag and her alone
canst thyself not brew the potion

mephistopheles

that were a charming sport i own
id build a thousand bridges meanwhile ive a notion
not and science serve alone
patience in the work shown
long is the calm brain active in creation
time only strengthens the fine fermentation
and all belonging thereunto
is rare and strange howeer you take
the devil taught the thing tis true
and the devil cannot make

see what a delicate race they
that is the maid the man is he

seems the mistress has gone away

the animals

carousing today
off and about
by the chimney out

mephistopheles

what time takes she for dissipating

the animals

while we to warm our paws are waiting

mephistopheles

how findest the tender creatures

faust

absurder than i ever did see

mephistopheles

why just such talk as this for
is that which has the most attractive features



but tell cursed puppets
why do stir the porridge so

the animals

were cooking watery soup for beggars

mephistopheles

a great public you can show

the heape



o cast the dice
make rich in a trice
win in good season
things are badly controlled
and had i but gold
so had i my reason

mephistopheles

how the ape sure his luck enhances
could he but try the lotterys chances

in the meantime the young apes have been playing with a
large ball which they roll forward

the heape

the worlds the ball
rise and fall
and roll incessant
like glass ring
a hollow thing—
how soon willt spring
and drop quiescent
bright gleams
brighter seems
i live at present
dear son i say
keep away
doom is spoken
tis made of clay
and will broken

mephistopheles

what means the sieve

the heape

wert the thief
id know him and shame him



look through the sieve
knowst the thief
and darest not name him

mephistopheles

and whats this pot

heape and sheape

the fool knows not
he knows not the pot
he knows not the kettle

mephistopheles

impertinent beast

the heape

take the brush at least
and sit down on the settle



faust

who during all this time has been standing before a mirror
approaching and retreating from

what do i see what heavenly revealed
shows through the glass from magics fair dominions
o lend love the swiftest of pinions
and bear to her beauteous field
ah if i leave this spot with fond designing
if i attempt to venture near
dim as through gathering mist her charms appear—
a womans in beauty shining
can woman so lovely
and i find her body there reclining
of all the heavens the bright epitome
can earth with such a thing mated

mephistopheles

why surely if a god first plagues himself six days
selfcontented bravo says
something clever created
this time thine eyes satiate
ill detect sweetheart and ensnare her
and blest is he who has the lucky fate
some day as bridegroom home to bear her

faust gazes continually in the mirror mephistopheles
stretching himself out on the settle and playing with the
brush continues to speak

so sit i like the king his throne
i hold the sceptre here—and lack the crown alone

the animals

who up to this time have been making all kinds of fantastic
movements together bring a crown to mephistopheles
with great noise

o so good
with sweat and with blood
the crown to belime

they handle the crown awkwardly and break into two
pieces with which they spring around

tis done
we speak and we see
we hear and we rhyme

faust

woes i fear to lose my wits

mephistopheles

my own head is really nigh to sinking

the animals

if lucky our hits
and everything fits
tis thoughts and were thinking

faust

my bosom burns with that sweet vision
with speed away from

mephistopheles

at least make this admission—
theyre poets genuine and sincere

the caldron which the sheape has up to this time neglected
to watch begins to boil over there ensues a great flame
which blazes out the chimney the witch comes careering
down through the flame with terrible cries

the witch

ow ow ow ow
the damnéd beast—the curséd sow
to leave the kettle and singe the frau
accurséd fere



what is that
who are you
what want you
who sneaks to
the firepain
burn bone and brain

she plunges the skimmingladle into the caldron and scatters
flames towards faust mephistopheles and the animals
the animals whimper

mephistopheles

reversing the brush which he has been holding in his hand
and striding among the jars and glasses

in two in two
there lies the brew
there lies the glass
the joke will pass
as time foul ass
to the singing of crew



ha knowst abomination
knowst at last lord and master
what hinders from smiting
and monkeysprites with fell disaster
for the scarlet coat no reverence
recognize no more the tall cocksfeather
have i concealed this countenance—
tell my name old face of leather

the witch

o pardon sir the rough salute
i perceive no cloven foot
and both your ravens where are they

mephistopheles

this time ill scape the debt
for since we two together met
tis verily full a day
culture which smooth the whole world licks
also unto the devil sticks
the days of that old northern phantom are over
where canst horns and tail and claws discover
and as regards the foot which i cant spare in truth
twould only make the people shun
therefore ive worn like a spindly youth
false calves these years

the witch

reason and sense forsake my brain
since i behold squire satan again

mephistopheles

woman from such a name refrain

the witch

why so what has done to

mephistopheles

its long been written in the book of fable
therefore no whit better men we see
the evil has left the evil ones are stable
sir baron call is the matter good
a cavalier am i like others in my bearing
no doubt about my noble blood
see heres the coatofarms that i am wearing



the witch

ha ha thats just your way i know
a rogue you are and you were always so

mephistopheles

my friend take proper heed i pray
to manage witches this is just the way

the witch

wherein sirs can i of use

mephistopheles

give a goblet of the wellknown juice
but i beg you of the oldest brewage
the years a double strength produce

the witch

with all my heart heres a bottle
wherefrom sometimes i wet my throttle
which also not the slightest stinks
and willingly a glass ill fill him



if this man without due preparation drinks
as knowst within an hour twill kill him

mephistopheles

he is a friend of mine with whom will agree
and he deserves kitchens best potation
come draw circle speak thine adjuration
and fill goblet full and free

the witch

with fantastic gestures draws a circle and places mysterious
articles therein meanwhile the glasses begin to ring the
caldron to sound and make a musical accompaniment
finally she brings a great book and stations in the circle
the apes who are obliged to serve as readingdesk and to
hold the torches she beckons faust to approach

faust

what come of this the creatures antic
the crazy stuff the gestures frantic—
all the repulsive cheats i view—
are known to and hated too

mephistopheles

o nonsense thats a thing for laughter
dont so terribly severe
she juggles you as doctor that after
the beverage work the proper cheer



the witch



see its done
make ten of
and two
make three
and rich
cast oer the four
from five and six

make seven and eight
tis finished straight
and nine is
and ten is none
this is the witchs onceonesone

faust

she talks like who raves in fever

mephistopheles

thoult hear much more before we leave her
tis all the same the book i can repeat
such time ive squandered oer the history
a contradiction complete
is always for the wise no less than fools a mystery
the is old and new for verily
all ages have been taught the matter—
by three and and and three
error instead of truth to scatter
they prate and teach and no interferes
all from the fellowship of fools are shrinking
man usually believes if only words he hears
that also with them goes material for thinking

the witch

the lofty skill
of science
from all men deeply hidden
who takes no thought
to him tis brought
tis given unsought unbidden

faust

what nonsense she declaims before
my head is nigh to split i fear
seems to as if i hear
a hundred thousand fools in chorus

mephistopheles

o sibyl excellent enough of adjuration
but hither bring potation
and quickly fill the beaker to the brim
this drink will bring my friend no injuries
he is a man of manifold degrees
and draughts are known to him

the witch with ceremonies pours the drink into a
cup as faust sets to his lips a light flame arises

down with quickly drain off
twill warm heart with new desire
with the devil hand and glove
and wilt afraid of fire



mephistopheles

and away darst not rest

the witch

and much good the liquor do

mephistopheles

wish on walpurgis night expressed
what boon i have given unto

the witch

is a song which if you sometimes sing
youll find of peculiar operation

mephistopheles

come walk at once a rapid occupation
start the needful perspiration
and through frame the liquors potence fling
the noble indolence ill teach to treasure
and soon thoult aware with keenest thrills of pleasure
how cupid stirs and leaps on light and restless wing

faust

rapid glance within the mirror give
how beautiful that womanform

mephistopheles

no no the paragon of all believe
soon see alive and warm



thoult find this drink blood compelling
each woman beautiful as helen

street

faust margaret

faust

fair lady not offend you
that arm and escort i lend you

margaret

im neither lady neither fair
and home i can go without your care

she releases herself and exit

faust

by heaven the girl is wondrous fair
of all ive seen beyond compare
so sweetly virtuous and pure
and a little pert sure
the lip so red the cheeks clear dawn

ill not forget while the world rolls on
how she cast down her timid eyes
deep in my heart imprinted lies
how short and sharp of speech was she
why twas a real ecstasy



faust

hear of that girl id have possession

mephistopheles

which

faust

the who just went by

mephistopheles

she there shes coming from confession
of every sin absolved for i
behind her chair was listening nigh
so innocent is she indeed
that to confess she had no need
i have no power oer souls so green

faust

and shes older than fourteen

mephistopheles

how youre talking like jack rake
who every flower for himself take
and fancies there are no favors more
nor honors save for him in store
always doesnt the thing succeed

faust

most worthy pedagogue take heed
not a word of moral law spoken
i claim i tell all my right
and if that image of delight
rest not within mine arms tonight
at midnight is our compact broken

mephistopheles

but think the chances of the case
i need at least a fortnights space
to find an opportune occasion

faust

had i but seven hours for all
i should not on the devil call
but win her by my own persuasion

mephistopheles

you almost like a frenchman prate
pray dont take as annoyance
why all at once exhaust the joyance
your bliss is by no means so great
as if youd use to get control
all sorts of tender rigmarole
and knead and shape her to your thought
as in italian tales tis taught

faust

without that i have appetite

mephistopheles

but leave jesting out of sight
i tell you once for all that speed
with this fair girl will not succeed
by storm she cannot captured
we make use of strategy

faust

get something the angel keeps
lead thither where she sleeps
get a kerchief from her breast—
a garter that her knee has pressed

mephistopheles

that you see how much id fain
further and satisfy your pain
we will no longer lose a minute
ill find her room today and take you in

faust

and i see—possess her

mephistopheles

no
unto a neighbor she go
and meanwhile alone mayst glow
with every hope of future pleasure
breathing her atmosphere in fullest measure

faust

can we go thither

mephistopheles

tis too early

faust

a gift for her i bid get
exit

mephistopheles

presents at once thats good hes certain to get at her
full a pleasant place i know
and treasures buried long ago
i perforce look up the matter exit

evening a small neatly kept chamber

margaret



id something give could i but say
who was that gentleman today
surely a gallant man was he
and of a noble family
and much could i in his face behold—
and he wouldnt else have been so bold

exit

mephistopheles faust

mephistopheles

come in but gently follow

faust

leave alone i beg of

mephistopheles

not every girl keeps things so neat

faust

o welcome twilight soft and sweet
that breathes throughout this hallowed shrine
sweet pain of love bind with fetters fleet
the heart that on the dew of hope pine
how all around a sense impresses
of quiet order and content
this poverty what bounty blesses
what bliss within this narrow den is pent



receive that in thine open arms
departed joy and pain wert wont to gather
how oft the children with their ruddy charms
hung around this throne where sat the father
perchance my love amid the childish band
grateful for gifts the holy christmas gave her
meekly kissed the grandsires withered hand
i feel o maid very soul
of order and content around whisper—
which leads with its motherly control
the cloth board bids smoothly unroll
the sand beneath feet makes whiter crisper
o dearest hand to tis given
to change this hut into a lower heaven
and



what sweetest thrill is in my blood
could i spend whole hours delaying
nature shaped as if in sportive playing
the angel blossom from the bud
lay the child with lifes warm essence
the tender bosom filled and fair
and was wrought through holier purer presence
the diviner beings wear

and i what drew with power
how deeply am i moved this hour
what seek i why so full my heart and sore
miserable faust i know no more

is there a magic vapor
i came with lust of instant pleasure
and lie dissolved in dreams of loves sweet leisure
are we the sport of every changeful atmosphere

and if this moment came she in to
how i for the fault atonement render
how small the giant lout
prone at her feet relaxed and tender

mephistopheles

quick i see her there returning

faust

go go i never will retreat

mephistopheles

is a casket not unmeet
which elsewhere i have just been earning
set in the press with haste
i swear twill turn her head to spy
some baubles i therein had placed
that you might win another by
true child is child and play is play

faust

i know not should i do

mephistopheles

ask you pray
yourself perhaps keep the bubble
i suggest twere fair and just
to spare the lovely day your lust
and spare to the further trouble
you are not miserly i trust
i rub my hands in expectation tender—



quick away
the sweet young maiden to betray
so that by wish and will you bend her
and you look as though
to the lecturehall you were forced to go—
as if stood before you gray and loath
physics and metaphysics both
but away exeunt

margaret

is so close so sultry



and tis not so warm outside
i feel i know not why such fear—
mother came—where can she bide
my bodys chill and shuddering—
im but a silly fearsome thing



there was a king in thule
was faithful till the grave—
to whom his mistress dying
a golden goblet gave

naught was to him more precious
he drained at every bout
his eyes with tears ran over
as oft as he drank thereout

when came his time of dying
the towns in his land he told
naught else to his heir denying
except the goblet of gold

he sat at the royal banquet
with his knights of high degree
in the lofty hall of his fathers
in the castle by the sea

there stood the old carouser
and drank the last lifeglow
and hurled the hallowed goblet
into the tide below

he saw plunging and filling
and sinking deep in the sea
fell his eyelids forever
and never more drank he

she opens the press in order to arrange her clothes and perceives
the casket of jewels

how comes that lovely casket to
i locked the press most certainly
tis truly wonderful what can within
perhaps twas brought by some as a pawn
and mother gave a loan thereon
and there hangs a key to fit
i have a mind to open
what is that god in heaven whence came
such things never beheld i aught so fair
rich ornaments such as a noble dame
on highest holidays might wear
how the pearlchain suit my hair
ah who all this splendor own

she adorns herself with the jewelry and steps before the
mirror

were but the earrings mine alone
has at once another air
what helps ones beauty youthful blood
possess them and good
but none the more do others care
they praise half in pity sure
to gold tends
on gold depends
all all alas we poor

promenade



mephistopheles

by all love ever rejected by hellfire hot and unsparing
i wish i knew something worse that i might use for
swearing

faust

what ails what ist gripes elf
a face like thine beheld i never

mephistopheles

i myself unto the devil deliver
if i were not a devil myself

faust

head is out of order sadly
much becomes to raving madly

mephistopheles

just think the pocket of a priest should get
the trinkets left for margaret
the mother saw them and instanter
a secret dread began to haunt her
keen scent has she for tainted air
she snuffs within her book of prayer
and smells each article to see
if sacred or profane
so she guessed from every gem
that not much blessing came with them
my child she said illgotten good
ensnares the soul consumes the blood
before the mother of god lay
with heavenly manna shell repay
but margaret thought with sour grimace
a gifthorse is not out of place
and truly godless cannot
the who brought such things to
a parson came by the mother bidden
he saw at once where the game was hidden
and viewed with a favor stealthy
he spake that is the proper view—
who overcometh winneth too
the holy church has a stomach healthy
eaten a land as forfeit
and never complained of surfeit
the church alone beyond all question
has for illgotten goods the right digestion

faust

a general practice is the same
which jew and king also claim

mephistopheles

bagged the spangles chains and rings
as if but toadstools were the things
and thanked no less and thanked no more
than if a sack of nuts he bore—
promised them fullest heavenly pay
and deeply edified were they

faust

and margaret

mephistopheles

sits unrestful
and knows not what she should or will
thinks on the jewels day and night
but more on him who gave her such delight

faust

the darlings sorrow gives pain
get a set for her again
the first was not a great display

mephistopheles

o yes the gentleman finds all childsplay

faust

fix and arrange to my will
and on her neighbor try skill
dont a devil stiff as paste
but get fresh jewels to her taste

mephistopheles

yes gracious sir in all obedience

exit faust

such an enamored fool in air blow
sun moon and all the starry legions
to give his sweetheart a diverting show

the neighbors house

martha

god forgive my husband he
hasnt done his duty by
off in the world he went straightway—
left lie in the straw where i lay
and truly i did naught to fret him
god knows i loved and cant forget him



perhaps hes dead ah woe—
had i a certificate to show

margaret

dame martha

martha

margaret whats happened

margaret

i scarce can stand my knees are trembling
i find a box the first resembling
within my press of ebony—
and things all splendid to behold
and richer far than were the old

martha

you mustnt tell to your mother
twould go to the priest as did the other

margaret

ah look and see—just look and see

martha

o what a blessed luck for

margaret

but ah in the streets i dare not bear them
nor in the church seen to wear them

martha

canst often this way wander
and secretly the jewels don
walk up and down an hour before the mirror yonder—
have our private joy thereon
and a chance will come a holiday
when piece by piece can the things abroad display
a chain at first other ornament
mother will not see and stories invent

margaret

whoever could have brought things so precious
that somethings wrong i feel suspicious



good heaven my mother can that have been

martha

tis some strange gentleman—come in




mephistopheles

that i so boldly introduce
i beg you ladies to excuse



for martha schwerdtlein id inquire


martha

im she what does the gentleman desire


mephistopheles

is enough that you are she
youve a visitor of high degree
pardon the freedom i have taen—
will after noon return again


martha

of all things in the world just hear—
he takes for a lady dear


margaret

i am a creature young and poor
the gentlemans too kind im sure
the jewels dont belong to


mephistopheles

ah not alone the jewelry
the look the manner both betray—
rejoiced am i that i stay


martha

what is your business i fain—

mephistopheles

i i had a more cheerful strain
take not unkindly its repeating
your husbands dead and sends a greeting


martha

is dead alas that heart so true
my husband dead die too


margaret

ah dearest dame not your courage fail


mephistopheles

hear relate the mournful tale


margaret

therefore id never love believe
a loss like this to death grieve


mephistopheles

joy follows woe woe after joy comes flying


martha

relate his lifes sad close to


mephistopheles

in padua buried he is lying
beside the good saint antony
within a grave consecrated
for cool eternal rest created


martha

he gave you further no commission

mephistopheles

yes of weight with sighs
three hundred masses buy to save him from perdition
my hands are empty otherwise


martha

what not a pocketpiece no jewelry
what every journeyman within his wallet spares
and as a token with him bears
and rather starves or begs than loses


mephistopheles

madam is a grief to
on my word his cash was put to proper uses
besides his penitence was very sore
and he lamented his ill fortune all the more


margaret

alack that men are so unfortunate
surely for his souls sake full a prayer ill proffer


mephistopheles

you deserve a speedy marriageoffer
you are so kind compassionate


margaret

o no as not do


mephistopheles

if not a husband a beau for you
is the greatest heavenly blessing
to have a dear thing for ones caressing


margaret

the countrys custom is not so

mephistopheles

custom or not happens though


martha

continue pray


mephistopheles

i stood beside his bed of dying
twas something better than manure—
halfrotten straw and he died a christian sure
and found that heavier scores to his account were lying
he cried i find my conduct wholly hateful
to leave my wife my trade in manner so ungrateful
ah the remembrance makes die
of my wrong to her i might shriven


martha

the dear good man long since was he forgiven


mephistopheles

she god knows was more to blame than i


martha

he lied what on the brink of death he slandered


mephistopheles

in the last throes his senses wandered
if i such things but half can judge
he said i had no time for play for gaping freedom
first children and work for bread to feed em—
for bread in the widest sense to drudge
and could not eat my share in peace and quiet


martha

had he all love all faith forgotten in his riot
my work and worry day and night

mephistopheles

not so the memory of touched him quite
said he when i from malta went away
my prayers for wife and little ones were zealous
and such a luck from heaven befell
we made a turkish merchantman our prey
that to the soldan bore a mighty treasure
i received as was most fit
since bravery was paid in fullest measure
my wellapportioned share of


martha

say how say where if buried did he own


mephistopheles

who knows whither the four winds have blown
a fair young damsel took him in her care
as he in naples wandered round unfriended
and she much love much faith to him did bear
so that he felt till his days were ended


martha

the villain from his children thieving
all the misery on him cast
could not prevent his shameful way of living


mephistopheles

but see hes dead therefrom at last
were i in your place do not doubt
id mourn him decently a year
and for another keep meanwhile my eyes about


martha

ah god another so dear
as was my first this world will hardly give
there never was a sweeter fool than mine
only he loved to roam and leave
and foreign wenches and foreign wine
and the damned throw of dice indeed


mephistopheles

that might have done however
if he had only been as clever
and treated your slips with as little heed
i swear with this condition too
i myself change rings with you


martha

the gentleman is pleased to jest


mephistopheles

ill cut away betimes from
shed take the devil at his word i fear



how fares the heart within your breast


margaret

what means the gentleman


mephistopheles

sweet innocent



ladies farewell


margaret

farewell


martha

a moment ere we part
id like to have a legal witness
where how and when he died to certify his fitness
irregular ways ive always hated
i want his death in the weekly paper stated


mephistopheles

yes my good dame a pair of witnesses
always the truth establishes
i have a friend of high condition
wholl also add his deposition
ill bring him


martha

good sir pray do


mephistopheles

and this young lady will present too
a gallant youth has travelled far
ladies with him delighted are


margaret

faust

how is under way and soon complete

mephistopheles

ah bravo do i find you burning
margaret soon will your yearning
at neighbor marthas youll this evening meet
a fitter woman neer was made
to ply the pimp and gypsy trade

faust

tis

mephistopheles

something is required from

faust

service pays the other

mephistopheles

weve but to make a deposition valid
that her husbands limbs outstretched and pallid
at padua rest in consecrated soil

faust

most wise and first of course make the journey
thither

mephistopheles

sancta simplicitas no need of such a toil
depose with knowledge or without either

faust

if youve naught better ill tear your pretty plan

mephistopheles

there you are o holy man
is the first time in your life youre driven
to bear false witness in a case
of god the world and all that in has a place
of man and all that moves the being of his race
have you not terms and definitions given
with brazen forehead daring breast
and if youll probe the thing profoundly
knew you so much—and youll confess roundly—
as of schwerdtleins death and place of rest

faust

and remainst a sophist liar

mephistopheles

yes knew i not more deeply desire
for wilt not no lover fairer
poor margaret flatter and ensnare her
and all souls devotion swear her

faust

and from my heart

mephistopheles

tis very fine
thine endless love faith assuring
the almighty force enduring—
will that too prompt this heart of thine

faust

hold hold will—if such my flame
and for the sense and power intense
i seek and cannot find a name
range with all my senses through creation
craving the speech of inspiration
and call this ardor so supernal
endless eternal and eternal—
is that a devilish lying game

mephistopheles

and im right

faust

mark this i beg of
and spare my lungs henceforth whoever
intends to have the right if but his
tongue clever
will have certainly
but come the further talking brings
disgust
for right especially since i

garden

margaret on fausts arm martha and mephistopheles
walking up and down

margaret

i feel the gentleman allows for
demeans himself and shames by
a traveller is so used to
kindly content with any diet
i know too that my poor gossip can
neer entertain such an experienced man

faust

a look from a word more entertains
than all the lore of wisest brains



margaret

dont incommode yourself how could you ever kiss
is so ugly rough to see
what work i do—how hard and steady is
mother is much too close with

they pass

martha

and you sir travel always do you not

mephistopheles

alas that trade and duty so harry
with what a pang leaves so a spot
and dares not and to tarry

martha

in young wild years suits your ways
this round and round the world in freedom sweeping
but come on the evil days
and so as bachelor into his grave acreeping
none ever found a thing to praise

mephistopheles

i dread to see how such a fate advances

martha

worthy sir improve betimes your chances

they pass

margaret

yes out of sight is out of mind
your courtesy an easy grace is
but you have friends in other places
and sensibler than i youll find

faust

trust dear heart what men call sensible
is oft mere vanity and narrowness

margaret

how so

faust

ah that simplicity and innocence neer know
themselves their holy value and their spell
that meekness lowliness the highest graces
which nature portions out so lovingly—

margaret

so you but think a moments space on
all times ill have to think on you all places

faust

no doubt youre much alone

margaret

yes for our household small has grown
cared for you will own
we have no maid i do the knitting sewing sweeping
the cooking early work and late in fact
and mother in her notions of housekeeping
is so exact
not that she needs so much to keep expenses down
we more than others might take comfort rather
a nice estate was left by my father
a house a little garden near the town
but my days have less of noise and hurry
my brother is a soldier
my little sisters dead
true with the child a troubled life i led
i take again and willing all the worry
so very dear was she

faust

an angel if like

margaret

i brought up and was fond of
father had died before saw the light
and mothers case seemed hopeless quite
so weak and miserable she lay
and she recovered so slowly day by day
she could not think herself of giving
the poor wee thing its natural living
and so i nursed all alone
with milk and water twas my own
lulled in my lap with a song
smiled and tumbled and grew strong

faust

the purest bliss was surely dower

margaret

but surely also a weary hour
i kept the babys cradle near
my bed at night if t stirred id guess
and waking hear
and i nurse warm beside press
and oft to quiet my bed forsake
and dandling back and forth the restless creature take
at the washtub stand at mornings break
and the marketing and kitchentending
day after day the same thing neverending
ones spirits sir are not always good
but learns to relish rest and food

they pass

martha

yes the poor women are bad off tis true
a stubborn bachelor theres no converting

mephistopheles

but depends the like of you
and i should turn to better ways than flirting

martha

speak plainly sir have you no detected
has not your heart been anywhere subjected

mephistopheles

the proverb says ones own warm hearth
and a good wife are gold and jewels worth

martha

i mean have you not felt desire though neer so slightly

mephistopheles

ive everywhere in fact been entertained politely

martha

i meant to say were you not touched in earnest ever

mephistopheles

should allow ones self to jest with ladies never


martha
ah you dont understand

mephistopheles

im sorry im so blind
but i am sure—that you are very kind

they pass

faust

and angel didst recognize
as through the gardengate i came

margaret

did you not see i cast down my eyes

faust

and forgivst my freedom and the blame
to my impertinence befitting
as the cathedral wert quitting

margaret

i was confused the like neer happened
no could ever speak to my discredit
ah thought i in my conduct has he read it—
something immodest or unseemly free
he seemed to have the sudden feeling
that with this wench twere very easy dealing
i will confess i knew not what appeal
on your behalf in my bosom grew
but i was angry with myself to feel
that i could not angrier with you


faust

sweet darling

margaret

wait a while

she plucks a starflower and pulls off the leaves after
the other

faust

margaret

yes child and this blossomword
for speech divine he loves
ah knowst what means he loves



margaret

faust

o tremble not but this look
this warm clasp of hands declare
what is unspeakable
to yield wholly and to feel a rapture
in yielding that eternal
eternal—for the end despair
no no—no ending no ending

martha

the night is falling

mephistopheles

ay we away

martha

id ask you longer to tarry
but evil tongues in this town have full play
its as if nobody had nothing to fetch and carry
nor other labor
but spying all the doings of ones neighbor
and becomes the talk do whatsoeer
where is our couple

mephistopheles

flown up the alley yonder

forest and cavern

faust

spirit sublime gavst gavst all
for which i prayed not unto in vain
countenance revealed in fire
gavst nature as a kingdom grand
with power to feel and to enjoy
not only cold amazed acquaintance yieldst
but grantest that in her profoundest breast
i gaze as in the bosom of a friend
the ranks of living creatures lead
before teaching to know my brothers
in air and water and the silent wood
and when the storm in forests roars and grinds
the giant firs in falling neighbor boughs
and neighbor trunks with crushing weight bear down
and falling fill the hills with hollow thunders—
to the cave secure leadest
showst mine own self and in my breast
the deep mysterious miracles unfold
and when the perfect moon before my gaze
comes up with soothing light around float
from every precipice and thicket damp
the silvery phantoms of the ages past
and temper the austere delight of thought

that nothing can perfect unto man
i am conscious with this ecstasy
which brings near and nearer to the gods
gavst the comrade whom i no more
can do without though cold and scornful he
demeans to myself and with a breath
a word transforms gifts to nothingness
within my breast he fans a lawless fire
unwearied for that fair and lovely
in desire i hasten to enjoyment
and in enjoyment pine to feel desire



mephistopheles

have you not led this life quite long enough
how can a further test delight you
tis very that once tries the stuff
but something new requite you

faust

there were other work for
to plague my day auspicious returnest

mephistopheles

ill engage to
darest not tell so in earnest
the loss of were truly very slight—
comrade crazy rude repelling



has ones hands full all the day and night
if what does or leaves undone is right
from such a face as thine there is no telling

faust

there is again proper tone—
that bored i thankful

mephistopheles

poor son of earth how couldst alone
have led life bereft of
i for a time at least have worked cure
fancys rickets plague not at all
had i not been so hadst sure
walked thyself off this earthly ball
why to caverns rocky hollows slinking
sitst as twere an owl ablinking
why suckst from sodden moss and dripping stone
toadlike nourishment alone
a fine way this time to fill
the doctors in body

faust

what fresh and vital forces canst guess
spring from my commerce with the wilderness
but if hadst the power of guessing
wouldst devil enough to grudge my soul the blessing

mephistopheles

a blessing drawn from supernatural fountains
in night and dew to lie the mountains
all heaven and earth in rapture penetrating
thyself to godhood haughtily inflating
to grub with yearning force through earths dark marrow
compress the six days work within bosom narrow—
to taste i know not what in haughty power
thine own ecstatic life on all things shower
thine earthly self behind cast
and the lofty instinct thus—



at last—
darent say how—to pluck the final flower

faust

shame on

mephistopheles

yes findest that unpleasant
the moral right to cry shame at present
dares not that before chaste ears declare
which chaste hearts notwithstanding cannot spare
and once for all i grudge not the pleasure
of lying to thyself in moderate measure
but such a course wilt not long endure
already oerexcited
and if last wilt soon plighted
to madness and to horror sure
enough of that love sits lonely yonder
by all things saddened and oppressed
her thoughts and yearnings seek tenderer fonder—
mighty love is in her breast
first came passions flood and poured around her
as when from melted snow a streamlet overflows
therewith so filled and drowned her
that stream all shallow shows
methinks instead of in the forests lording
the noble sir should find good
the love of this young silly blood
at once to set about rewarding
her time is miserably long
she haunts her window watching clouds that stray
oer the old citywall and far away
were i a little bird so runs her song
day long and half night long
she is lively mostly sad
wept beyond her tears
again quiet she appears—always
lovemad

faust

serpent serpent

mephistopheles

ha do i trap

faust

get away with thine offences
reprobate name not that fairest thing
nor the desire for her sweet body bring
again before my halfdistracted senses

mephistopheles

what wouldst she thinks that flown
and half and half i own

faust

am i near and love keeps watch and ward
though i were neer so far cannot falter
i envy the body of the lord
the touching of her lips before the altar

mephistopheles

tis very my envy oft reposes
on your twinpair that feed among the roses

faust

away pimp

mephistopheles

you rail and is fun to
the god who fashioned youth and maid
perceived the noblest purpose of his trade
and also made their opportunity
go on is a woe profound
tis for your sweethearts room youre bound
and not for death indeed

faust

what are within her arms the heavenly blisses
though i glowing with her kisses
do i not always share her need
i am the fugitive all houseless roaming
the monster without air or rest
that like a cataract down rocks and gorges foaming
leaps maddened into the abysss breast
and sidewards she with young unwakened senses
within her cabin on the alpine field
her simple homely life commences
her little world therein concealed
and i gods hate flung oer
had not enough to thrust
the stubborn rocks before
and strike them into dust
she and her peace i undermine
hell claimed this sacrifice as thine
help devil through the coming pangs to push
what quickly
fall on her fate and also crush me—
ruin whelm both her and

mephistopheles

again seethes again glows
fool go in and comfort her
when such a head as thine no outlet knows
thinks the end soon occur
hail him who keeps a steadfast mind
else the devilnature wear
naught so insipid in the world i find
as is a devil in despair

my peace is gone
my heart is sore
i never find
ah nevermore

save i have him near
the grave is
the world is gall
and bitterness all

my poor weak head
is racked and crazed
my thought is lost
my senses mazed

my peace is gone
my heart is sore
i never find
ah nevermore

to see him him only
at the pane i sit
to meet him him only
the house i quit

his lofty gait
his noble size
the smile of his mouth
the power of his eyes

and the magic flow
of his talk the bliss
in the clasp of his hand
and ah his kiss

my peace is gone
my heart is sore
i never find
ah nevermore

my bosom yearns
for him alone
ah dared i clasp him
and hold and own

and kiss his mouth
to hearts desire
and on his kisses
at last expire

faust

margaret

how ist with religion pray
a dear goodhearted man
and i think not incline that way

faust

leave that my child knowst my love is tender
for love my blood and life i surrender
and as for faith and church i grant to each his own

margaret

thats not enough we believe thereon

faust

we

margaret

that i had some influence
too honorest not the holy sacraments

faust

i honor them

margaret

desiring no possession
tis long since been to mass or to confession
believest in god

faust

my darling who dare
i believe in god to say
ask priest or sage the answer to declare
and will seem a mocking play
a sarcasm on the asker

margaret

believest not

faust

hear not falsely sweetest countenance
who dare express him
and who profess him
saying i believe in him
who feeling seeing
deny his being
saying i believe him not
the allenfolding
the allupholding
folds and upholds he not
himself
arches not there the sky above
lies not beneath firm the earth
and rise not on shining
friendly the everlasting stars
look i not eye to eye on
and feelst not thronging
to head and heart the force
weaving its eternal secret
invisible visible round life
vast as is fill with that force heart
and when in the feeling wholly blessed
call what wilt—
call bliss heart love god
i have no name to give
feeling is all in all
the name is sound and smoke
obscuring heavens clear glow

margaret

all that is fine and good to hear so
much the same way the preacher spoke
only with slightly different phrases

faust

the same thing in all places
all hearts that beat beneath the heavenly day—
each in its language—say
why not i in mine as

margaret

to hear seem passable
and some hitch int there
for no christianity

faust

dear love

margaret

ive long been grieved to see
that in such company

faust

how so

margaret

the man who with goes mate
within my deepest inmost soul i hate
in all my life theres nothing
has given my heart so keen a pang of loathing
as his repulsive face has done

faust

nay fear him not my sweetest

margaret

i feel his presence like something ill
ive else for all a kindly will
but much as my heart to see yearneth
the secret horror of him returneth
and i think the man a knave as i live
if i do him wrong god forgive

faust

there such queer birds however

margaret

live with the like of him i never
when once inside the door comes he
he looks around so sneeringly
and half in wrath
sees that in nothing no interest he
tis written on his very forehead
that love to him is a thing abhorréd
i am so happy on thine arm
so free so yielding and so warm
and in his presence stifled seems my heart

faust

foreboding angel that

margaret

overcomes in such degree
that wheresoeer he meets
i feel as though id lost my love for
when he is by i could not pray to heaven
that burns within like a flame
and surely henry tis with the same

faust

there is thine antipathy

margaret

but i go

faust

ah there never
a quiet hour to see fondly plighted
with breast to breast and soul to soul united

margaret

ah if i only slept alone
id draw the bolts tonight for desire
but mothers sleep so light has grown
and if we were discovered by her
twould my death the spot

faust

angel fear not
is a phial in her drink
but three drops of measure
and deepest sleep will on her senses sink

margaret

what i not to give pleasure
will not harm her when tries

faust

if twould my love i advise

margaret

ah dearest man if but face i see
i know not what compels to will
so much have i already done for
that scarcely more is left to fulfil

exit

mephistopheles

the monkey is she gone

faust

played the spy again

mephistopheles

ive heard most fully how she drew
the doctor has been catechised tis plain
great good i hope the thing will do
the girls have much desire to ascertain
if is prim and good as ancient rules compel
if there hes led they think hell follow them as

faust

monster wilt nor see nor own
how this pure soul of faith so lowly
so loving and ineffable—
the faith alone
that her salvation is—with scruples holy
pines lest she hold as lost the man she loves so

mephistopheles

full of sensual supersensual desire
a girl by the nose is leading

faust

abortion of filth and fire

mephistopheles

and how masterly she reads physiognomy
when i am present shes impressed she knows not how
she in my mask a hidden sense read
she feels that surely im a genius now—
perhaps the very devil indeed
well—tonight—

faust

whats that to

mephistopheles

my delight twill also

at the fountain

margaret and lisbeth with pitchers

lisbeth

nothing heard of barbara

margaret

no not a word i go so little out

lisbeth

its true sibylla said today
shes played the fool at last theres not a doubt
such takingon of airs

margaret

how so

lisbeth

stinks
shes feeding two wheneer she eats and drinks

margaret

ah

lisbeth

and so at last serves her rightly
she clung to the fellow so long and tightly
that was a promenading
at village and dance parading
as the first they everywhere shine
and he treated her always to pies and wine
and she made a todo with her face so fine
so mean and shameless was her behavior
she took all the presents the fellow gave her
twas kissing and coddling on and on
so at the end the flower is gone

margaret

the poor poor thing

lisbeth

pity her at that
when of at spinning sat
and mother nights neer out the door
she sported with her paramour
on the doorbench in the passage dark
the length of the time theyd never mark
so her head no more shell lift
but do churchpenance in her sinners shift

margaret

hell surely take her for his wife

lisbeth

hed a fool a brisk young blade
has room elsewhere to ply his trade
besides hes gone

margaret

that is not fair

lisbeth

if him she gets why her beware
the boys dash her wreath on the floor
and scatter chaff before her door
exit

margaret

how scornfully i once reviled
when some poor maiden was beguiled
more speech than any tongue suffices
i craved to censure others vices
black as seemed i blackened
and blacker was in my will
and blessed myself and boasted high—
and now—a living sin am i
yet—all that drove my heart thereto
god was so good so dear so true

in a niche of the wall a shrine with an image of the mater
dolorosa pots of flowers before

margaret



incline o maiden
sorrowladen
gracious countenance my pain

the sword heart in
with anguish smarting
lookest up to where son is slain

seest the father
sad sighs gather
and bear aloft sorrow and his pain

ah past guessing
beyond expressing
the pangs that wring my flesh and bone
why this anxious heart so burneth
why trembleth why yearneth
knowest and alone

whereer i go what sorrow
what woe what woe and sorrow
within my bosom aches
alone and ah unsleeping
im weeping weeping weeping
the heart within breaks

the pots before my window
alas my tears did wet
as in the early morning
for these flowers i set

within my lonely chamber
the morning sun shone red
i sat in utter sorrow
already on my bed

help rescue from death and stain
o maiden
sorrowladen
incline countenance my pain

night

street before margarets door

valentine

when i have sat at some carouse
where each to each his brag allows
and a comrade praised to
his pink of girls right lustily
with brimming glass that spilled the toast
and elbows planted as in boast
i sat in unconcerned repose
and heard the swagger as rose
and stroking my beard id say
smiling the bumper in my hand
each enough in her own way
but is there in all the land
like sister margaret good as gold—
that to her can a candle hold
cling clang heres to her went around
the board he speaks the truth cried some
in her the flower o the sex is found
and all the swaggerers were dumb
and now—i could tear my hair with vexation
and dash out my brains in desperation
with turnedup nose each scamp face
with sneers and stinging taunts disgrace
and like a bankrupt debtor sitting
a chancedropped word set sweating
though i thresh them all together
i cannot call them liars either

but what comes sneaking there to view
if i mistake not there are two
if hes at him drive
he not leave the spot alive

faust mephistopheles

faust

how from the window of the sacristy
upward theternal lamp sends forth a glimmer
that lessening sidewards fainter grows and dimmer
till darkness closes from the sky
the shadows within my bosom gather

mephistopheles

im like a sentimental tomcat rather
that round the tall fireladders sweeps
and stealthy along the coping creeps
quite virtuous withal i come
a little thievish and a little frolicsome
i feel in every limb the presage
forerunning the grand walpurgisnight
day after tomorrow brings its message
and keeps watch with delight

faust

meanwhile not the treasure risen
which there behind i glimmering see

mephistopheles

soon experience the pleasure
to lift the kettle with its treasure
i lately gave therein a squint—
saw splendid liondollars in t

faust

not a jewel not a ring
to deck therewith my darling girl

mephistopheles

i saw among the rest a thing
that seemed to a chain of pearl

faust

thats indeed for painful is
to bring no gift when her i visit

mephistopheles

shouldst not find so annoying
without return to enjoying
while the sky leads forth its starry throng
thoult hear a masterpiece no work completer
ill sing her first a moral song
the surer afterwards to cheat her



what
in daybreak clear
kathrina dear
before lovers door
beware the blade
lets in a maid
that out a maid
departeth nevermore

the coaxing shun
of such an
when once tis done
goodnight to poor thing
loves time is brief
unto no thief
warm and lief
but with the weddingring

valentine

whom wilt lure godselement
ratcatching piper thou—perdition
to the devil first the instrument
to the devil the curst musician

mephistopheles

the cithers smashed for nothing more tis fitting

valentine

theres a skull i splitting

mephistopheles

sir doctor dont retreat i pray
stand by ill lead if youll but tarry
out with your spit without delay

how is my hands already lame

mephistopheles

thrust home

valentine

o god

mephistopheles

but come away tis time for to fly
for there arises a murderous cry
with the police twere easy to compound

my margaret see young
but not the least bit shrewd or smart
business to slight
so this advice i bid heed—
that a whore indeed
why outright

margaret

my brother god such words to

valentine

in this game our lord god
whats dones already done alas
what follows come to pass
with beginst secretly
soon will others come to
and when a dozen have known
thourt also free to all the town
when shame is born and first appears
she is in secret brought to light
and they draw the veil of night
over her head and ears
her life in fact theyre loath to spare her
but her growth and strength display
she walks abroad unveiled by day
is not grown a whit the fairer
the uglier she is to sight
the more she seeks the days broad light
the time i verily can discern
when all the honest folk will turn
from jade and seek protection
as from a corpse that breeds infection
guilty heart dismay
when they but look in the face—
not in a golden chain array
nor at the altar take place
not in lace and ribbons flowing
make merry when the dance is going
but in some corner woe betide
among the beggars and cripples hide
and so though god forgive
on earth a damned existence live

martha

commend your soul to god for pardon
that you your heart with slander harden

valentine

pimp most infamous
could i withered body kill
twould bring for all my sinful pleasure
forgiveness in the richest measure

margaret

my brother this is hells own pain

valentine

i tell from tears refrain
when from honor didst depart
stabbed to the very heart
through the slumber of the grave
i go to god as a soldier brave

cathedral

service organ and anthem

margaret among much people the evil spirit behind
margaret

evil spirit

how otherwise was margaret
when innocent
to the altar camst
and from the worn and fingered book
prayers didst prattle
half sport of childhood
half god within
margaret
where tends thought
within bosom
what hidden crime
prayst for mercy on mothers soul
that fell asleep to long long torment and through
threshold whose the blood
and stirreth not and quickens
something beneath heart
life disquieting
with most foreboding presence

margaret

woe woe
i were free from the thoughts
that cross drawing hither and thither
despite

chorus

diesira dies illa
solvet soeclum in favilla


evil spirit

wrath takes
the trumpet peals
the graves tremble
and heart
from ashy rest
to fiery torments
again requickened
throbs to life

margaret

i were forth
i feel as if the organ
my breath takes from
my very heart
dissolved by the anthem


chorus

judex ergo cum sedebit
quidquid latet ad parebit
nil inultum remanebit
margaret

i cannot breathe
the massy pillars
imprison
the vaulted arches
crush me—air

evil spirit

hide thyself sin and shame
stay never hidden
air light
woe to

chorus

quid sum miser tunc dicturus
quem patronem rogaturus
cum vix justus sit securus

they turn their faces
the glorified from
the pure their hands to offer
shuddering refuse
woe

walpurgisnight

the hartz mountains

district of schierke and elend

faust mephistopheles

mephistopheles

not wish a broomsticksteeds assistance
the sturdiest hegoat i gladly see
the way we take our goal is some distance

faust

so long as in my legs i feel the fresh existence
this knotted staff suffices
what need to shorten so the way
along this labyrinth of vales to wander
climb the rocky ramparts yonder
wherefrom the fountain flings eternal spray
is such delight my steps fain delay
the springtime stirs within the fragrant birches
and the firtree feels
should our limbs escape its gentle searches

mephistopheles

i notice no such thing i vow
tis winter within my body
my path i wish for frost and snow
how sadly rises incomplete and ruddy
the moons lone disk with its belated glow
and lights so dimly that as advances
at every step strikes a rock or tree
use a jackolanterns glances
i see yonder burning merrily
ho there my friend ill levy thine attendance
why waste so vainly resplendence
kind enough to light up the steep

willothewisp

my reverence i hope will enable
to curb my temperament unstable
for zigzag courses we are wont to keep

mephistopheles

indeed hed like mankind to imitate
in the devils name go straight
or ill blow out his beings flickering spark

willothewisp

you are the master of the house i mark
and i try to serve you nicely
but reflect the mountains magicmad today
and if a willothewisp guide you on the way
you mustnt take things too precisely

faust mephistopheles willothewisp



we seems have entered newly
in the sphere of dreams enchanted
do bidding guide truly
that our feet forwards planted
in the vast the desert spaces
see them swiftly changing places
trees on trees beside trooping
and the crags above stooping
and the rocky snouts outgrowing—
hear them snoring hear them blowing
oer the stones the grasses flowing
stream and streamlet seek the hollow
hear i noises songs that follow
hear i tender lovepetitions
voices of those heavenly visions
sounds of hope of love undying
and the echoes like traditions
of old days come faint and hollow

hoohoo shoohoo nearer hover
jay and screechowl and the plover—
are they all awake and crying
ist the salamander pushes
bloatedbellied through the bushes
and the roots like serpents twisted
through the sand and boulders toiling
fright weirdest links uncoiling
to entrap unresisted
living knots and gnarls uncanny
feel with polypusantennae
for the wanderer mice are flying
thousandcolored herdwise hieing
through the moss and through the heather

and the fireflies wink and darkle
crowded swarms that soar and sparkle
and in wildering escort gather

tell if we are standing
or if further were ascending
all is turning whirling blending
trees and rocks with grinning faces
wandering lights that spin in mazes
increasing and expanding

mephistopheles

grasp my skirt with heart undaunted
a middlepeak is planted
whence seeth with amaze
mammon in the mountain blaze

faust

how strangely glimmers through the hollows
a dreary light like that of dawn
its exhalation tracks and follows
the deepest gorges faint and wan
steam there rolling vapor sweepeth
burns the glow through film and haze
like a tender thread creepeth
like a fountain leaps and plays
winds away and in a hundred
divided veins the valley braids
there in a corner pressed and sundered
itself detaches spreads and fades
gush the sparkles incandescent
like scattered showers of golden sand—
but see in all their height at present
the rocky ramparts blazing stand



mephistopheles

has not sir mammon grandly lighted
his palace for this festal night
tis lucky seen the sight
the boisterous guests approach that were invited

faust

how raves the tempest through the air
with what fierce blows my neck tis beating

mephistopheles

under the old ribs of the rock retreating
hold fast lest hurled down the abysses there
the night with the mist is black
hark how the forests grind and crack
frightened the owlets are scattered
hearken the pillars are shattered
the evergreen palaces shaking
boughs are groaning and breaking
the treetrunks terribly thunder
the roots are twisting asunder
in frightfully intricate crashing
each on the other is dashing
and over the wreckstrewn gorges
the tempest whistles and surges
hearst voices higher ringing
far away or nearer singing
yes the mountains side along
sweeps an infuriate glamouring song

witches

the witches ride to the brockens top
the stubble is yellow and green the crop
there gathers the crowd for carnival
sir urian sits over all

and so they go over stone and stock
the witch she——s and——s the buck

a voice

alone old baubos coming
she rides a farrowsow

chorus

honor to whom the honor is due
dame baubo first to lead the crew
a tough old sow and the mother thereon
follow the witches every

a voice

which way comst hither

voice

oer the ilsenstone
i peeped at the owl in her nest alone
how she stared and glared

voice

betake to hell
why so fast and so fell

voice

she has scored and has flayed
see the wounds she has made

witches

the way is wide the way is long
see what a wild and crazy throng
the broom scratches the fork thrusts
the child is stifled the mother bursts
wizards

as the snail in shell we crawl
before go the women all
when towards the devils house we tread
womans a thousand steps ahead

other semichorus

we do not measure with such care
woman in thousand steps is theft
but howsoeer she hasten
man in leap has cleared the way

voice

come on come on from rocky lake

voice

aloft wed fain ourselves betake
weve washed and are bright as ever you will
were eternally sterile

both choruses

the wind is hushed the star shoots by
the dreary moon forsakes the sky
the magic notes like spark on spark
drizzle whistling through the dark

voice

halt there ho there

voice

who calls from the rocky cleft below there

voice

take too take too
im climbing three hundred years
and the summit cannot see
among my equals i

both choruses

bears the broom and bears the stock
bears the fork and bears the buck
who cannot raise himself tonight
is evermore a ruined wight

halfwitch

so long i stumble ill bestead
and the others are so far ahead
at home ive neither rest nor cheer
and i cannot gain them

chorus of witches

to cheer the witch will salve avail
a rag will answer for a sail
each trough a goodly ship supplies
he neer will fly who not flies

both choruses

when round the summit whirls our flight
lower and on the ground alight
and far and wide the heather press
with witchhoods swarms of wantonness



mephistopheles

they crowd and push they roar and clatter
they whirl and whistle pull and chatter
they shine and spirt and stink and burn
the true witchelement we learn
keep close or we are parted in our turn
where

faust



mephistopheles

what whirled so far astray
houseright i use and clear the way
make room squire voland comes room gentle rabble
room

doctor hold to in jump resume
an easier space and from the crowd free
its too much for the like of
yonder with special light theres something shining clearer
within those bushes ive a mind to see
come on slip a little nearer

faust

spirit of contradiction on ill follow straight
tis planned most wisely if i judge aright
we climb the brockens top in the walpurgisnight
that arbitrarily ourselves we isolate

mephistopheles

but see what motley flames among the heather
there is a lively club together
in smaller circles is not alone

faust

better the summit i own
there fire and whirling smoke i see
they seek the evil in wild confusion
enigmas there might find solution

mephistopheles

but there enigmas also knotted
leave to the multitude their riot
will we house ourselves in quiet
is an old transmitted trade
that in the greater world the little worlds are made
i see starknude young witches congregate
and old ones veiled and hidden shrewdly
on my account kind nor treat them rudely
the troubles small the fun is great
i hear the noise of instruments attuning—
vile din learn to bear the crooning
come come along i declare
ill go ahead and introduce there
thine obligation newly earning
that is no little space what sayst friend
look yonder canst scarcely see the end
a hundred fires along the ranks are burning
they dance they chat they cook they drink they court
where just tell is there better sport

faust

wilt to introduce to the revel
assume the part of wizard or of devil

mephistopheles

im mostly used tis true to go incognito
but on a galaday his orders show
the garter does not deck my suit
but honored and at home is the cloven foot
perceivst yonder snail cometh slow and steady
so delicately its feelers pry
that scented already
i cannot disguise if i try
but come go from this fire to a newer
i am the gobetween and the wooer



old gentlemen why at the outskirts enter
id praise you if i found you snugly in the centre
with youth and revel round you like a zone
you each at home are quite enough alone

general

say who put his trust in nations
howeer for them have worked and planned
for with the people as with women
youth always has the upper hand

minister

theyre too far from what is just and sage
i praise the old ones not unduly
when we were allinall truly
was the real golden age

parvenu

we also were not stupid either
and what we should not often did
but all things have from their bases slid
just as we meant to hold them fast together

author

who a work of moderate sense will read
such works are held as antiquate and mossy
and as regards the younger folk indeed
they never have been so pert and saucy

mephistopheles



i feel that men are ripe for judgmentday
for the last time ive the witcheshill ascended
since to the lees my cask is drained away
the worlds as soon ended

hucksterwitch

gentlemen dont pass
not the chance neglected
behold my wares attentively
the stock is rare and various
and theres nothing ive collected—
no shop on earth like this youll find—
which has not once sore hurt inflicted
the world and on mankind
no daggers that set not blood to flowing
no cup that not once within a healthy frame
poured speedy death in poison glowing
no gems that have not brought a maid to shame
no sword but severed ties for the unwary
or from behind struck down the adversary

mephistopheles

gossip the times badly comprehendest
whats done has happed—what haps is done
twere better if for novelties sendest
by such alone can we won

faust

not lose myself in all this pother
this is a fair as never was another

mephistopheles

the whirlpool swirls to get above
thourt shoved thyself imagining to shove

faust

but who is that

mephistopheles

note her especially
tis lilith

faust

who

mephistopheles

adams first wife is she
beware the lure within her lovely tresses
the splendid sole adornment of her hair
when she succeeds therewith a youth to snare
not soon again she frees him from her jesses

faust

those two the old with the young sitting
theyve danced already more than fitting

mephistopheles

no rest tonight for young or old
they start another dance come take hold

faust

a lovely dream once came to
i beheld an appletree
and there two fairest apples shone
they lured so i climbed thereon

the fair

apples have been desired by you
since first in paradise they grew
and i am moved with joy to know
that such within my garden grow

mephistopheles

a dissolute dream once came to
therein i saw a cloven tree
which had a————————
yet——as twas i fancied

the old

i offer my best salute
unto the knight with cloven foot
him a—————prepare
if him—————————does not scare

proktophantasmist

accurséd folk how dare you venture
had you not long since demonstration
that ghosts cant stand on ordinary foundation
and you dance like of

the fair

why does he come to our ball

faust

o everywhere on him you fall
when others dance he weighs the matter
if he cant every step bechatter
tis the same as were the step not made
but if you forwards go his ire is most displayed
if you whirl in regular gyration
as he does in his dull old mill
hed show at any rate goodwill—
especially if you heard and heeded his hortation

proktophantasmist

you are nay tis a thing unheard
vanish at once weve said the enlightening word
the pack of devils by no rules is daunted
we are so wise and is tegel haunted
to clear the folly out how have i swept and stirred
twill neer clean why tis a thing unheard

the fair

cease to bore at our ball

proktophantasmist

i tell you spirits to your face
i give to spiritdespotism no place
my spirit cannot practise at all



naught will succeed i see amid such revels
something from a tour i always save
and hope before my last step to the grave
to overcome the poets and the devils

mephistopheles

he will seat him in the nearest puddle
the solace this whereof hes most assured
and when his rump the leeches hang and fuddle
hell of spirits and of spirit cured



forsakest the lovely maiden
that in the dance so sweetly sang

faust

ah in the midst of there sprang
a red mouse from her mouth—sufficient reason

mephistopheles

thats nothing not so squeamish
so the mouse was not gray enough for
whod think of that in loves selected season

faust

saw i—

mephistopheles

what

faust

mephisto seest there
alone and far a girl most pale and fair
she falters on her way scarce knowing
as if with fettered feet that stay her going
i confess seems to
as if my kindly margaret were she

mephistopheles

the thing all thence have evil drawn
is a magic shape a lifeless eidolon
such to encounter is not good
their blank set stare benumbs the human blood
and is almost turned to stone
medusas tale to is known

faust

forsooth the eyes they are of whom dying
no hand with loving pressure closed
that is the breast whereon i once was lying—
the body sweet beside which i reposed

mephistopheles

tis magic all fool seduced so easily
unto each man his love she seems to

faust

the woe the rapture so ensnare
that from her gaze i cannot tear
and strange around her fairest throat
a single scarlet band is gleaming
no broader than a knifeblade seeming

mephistopheles

quite right the mark i also note
her head beneath her arm shell sometimes carry
twas perseus lopped her old adversary
cravst the same illusion
come mount this little hill
the prater shows no livelier stir
and if theyve not bewitched my sense
i verily see a theatre
whats going on

servibilis
twill shortly recommence
a new performance—tis the last of seven
to give that number is the custom
twas by a dilettante written
and dilettanti in the parts appear
that i vanish pardon i entreat you
as dilettante i the curtain raise

mephistopheles
when i the blocksberg meet you
i find good for thats your proper place

powder becomes like petticoat

dungeon

faust



a shudder long unfelt comes oer
mankinds collected woe oerwhelms
she dwells within the dark damp walls before
and all her crime was a delusion dear
what i delay to free her
i dread once again to see her
on my shrinking but lingers death more near



my mother the harlot
who put to death
my father the varlet
who eaten
little sister so good
laid my bones in the wood
in the damp moss and clay
was i a beautiful bird o the wood
fly away fly away

faust

she does not dream her lover listens near
that he the rattling chain the rustling straw can hear



margaret
woe woe they come o death of bitterness

faust
hush hush the hour is come that frees

margaret

faust
cries will wake the guards and they will seize


margaret

who headsman unto such power
over could give
thourt come for at midnighthour
have mercy on live
ist not soon enough when morning chime has run



and i am so young so young
and death comes and ruin
i too was fair and that was my undoing
my love was near but hes far
torn lies the wreath scattered the blossoms are
seize not so violently
spare what have i done to
not vainly entreat
i never chanced in all my days to meet


faust

i outlive this misery


margaret

am i wholly in might
but suckle first my baby
i blissed all this livelong night
they took t away to vex maybe
and they say i killed the child outright
and never i glad again
they sing songs about tis bad of the folk to do
theres an old story has the same refrain
who bade them so construe


faust

lieth who loves ever
the thraldom of woe to sever


margaret

o kneel and call the saints to hide
under the steps beside
the threshold under
hell heaves in thunder
the evil
with terrible wrath
seeketh a path
his prey to discover

faust

margaret margaret


margaret

that was the voice of my lover



where is he i heard him call
i am free no enthrall
to his neck will i fly
on his bosom lie
on the threshold he stood and margaret calling
midst of hells howling and noises appalling
midst of the wrathful infernal derision
i knew the sweet sound of the voice of the vision


faust

tis i

margaret

tis o say once again



tis he tis he where is all my pain
the anguish of the dungeon and the chain
tis comest to save
and i am saved—
again the street i see
where first i looked on
and the garden brightly blooming
where i and martha wait coming


faust

come come with


margaret

delay
so fain i stay when delayest




faust

if longer stayest
we made to dearly rue

margaret

kiss me—canst no longer do
my friend so short a time thourt missing
and unlearned kissing
why is my heart so anxious on breast
where once a heaven glances did create
a heaven loving words expressed
and didst kiss as wouldst suffocate me—
kiss
or ill kiss



ah woe lips are chill
and
how changed in fashion
passion
who has done this ill



faust

come follow my darling more bold
ill clasp soon with warmth a thousandfold
but follow tis all i beg of

margaret

faust

and in lap wilt take once again
how comes that not shrink from me—
say know my friend whom makst free

faust

dear dear hand—but ah tis wet
why wipe off methinks that
theres blood thereon
ah god what done
nay sheathe sword at last

faust

o the past past
words will slay


margaret

no no outlive
ill tell the graves to give
begin tomorrow
the work of sorrow
the best place give to my mother
close at her side my brother
and a little away
but not too very far i pray
and on my right breast my baby lay
nobody else will lie beside me—
ah within thine arms to hide
that was a sweet and a gracious bliss
but no more no more can i attain
i force myself on and constrain
and seems repellest my kiss
and tis so good so kind to see


faust

margaret

up by the brook

over the bridge
into the wood
to the left where the plank is placed
in the pool

tis trying to rise
tis struggling
save save


faust

recall wandering will
step and free at last


margaret

if the mountain we had only passed
there sits my mother a stone—
i feel an icy shiver
there sits my mother a stone
and her head is wagging ever
she beckons she nods not her heavy head falls oer
she slept so long that she wakes no more
she slept while we were caressing
ah those were the days of blessing


faust

words and prayers are nothing worth
ill venture to bear forth


margaret

no—let go ill suffer no force
grasp not so murderously
ive done else all things for the love of


faust

the day dawns dearest dearest

margaret

day yes the day comes—the last day breaks for
my weddingday was to
tell no has been with margaret
woe for my garland the chances
are over—tis all in vain
we meet once again
but not at the dances
the crowd is thronging no word is spoken
the square below
and the streets overflow
the deathbell tolls the wand is broken
i am seized and bound and delivered—
shoved to the block—they give the sign
over each neck has quivered
the blade that is quivering over mine
dumb lies the world like the grave

faust

o had i neer been born

mephistopheles

off or youre lost ere morn
useless talking delaying and praying
my horses are neighing
the morning twilight is near

margaret

what rises up from the threshold

what does he want in this holy spot
he seeks

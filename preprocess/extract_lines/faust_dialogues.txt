woe i endure not

of flame i fear yes i am faust i am peer

who around the wide world wendest busy spirit how near i feel to



yes when the priest comedian is by nature as haply and the case

you’ll ne’er attain save you know the feeling save from the soul rises clear serene in primal strength compelling the hearts and minds of all who hear you sit forever gluing patching you cook the scraps from others’ fare and from your heap of ashes hatching a starveling flame blow bare take children’s monkeys’ gaze admiring if such your taste and content but ne’er from heart to heart you’ll speak inspiring save your own heart is eloquent

seek the honest recompense beware a tinkling fool to with little clear wit and sense suggest their own delivery and if thou’rt moved to speak in earnest what need that after words yearnest yes your discourses with their glittering show where for men twist shredded thought like paper are unrefreshing as the winds that blow the rustling leaves through chill autumnal vapor

is parchment the holy fount before a draught wherefrom thirst forever slakes no true refreshment can restore save what from thine own soul spontaneous breaks

o yes up to the stars at last listen my friend the ages that are past are a book with seven seals protected what you the spirit of the ages call is nothing but the spirit of you all wherein the ages are reflected so oftentimes you miserably mar at the first glance who sees runs away an offalbarrel and a lumbergarret or at the best a punchandjudy play with maxims most pragmatical and hitting as in the mouths of puppets are befitting

yes of the kind which men attain who dares the child’s true name in public mention the few who thereof something really learned unwisely frank with hearts that spurned concealing and to the mob laid bare each thought and feeling have evermore been crucified and burned i pray you friend the dead of night

that brain alone not loses hope whose choice is to stick in shallow trash forevermore— which digs with eager hand for buried ore and when finds an angleworm rejoices  dare such a human voice disturb the flow around of spiritpresence fullest and this once my thanks i owe to of all earth’s sons the poorest dullest for torn from that desperate state which threatened soon to overwhelm my senses the apparition was so giantgreat dwarfed and withered all my soul’s pretences  i image of the godhead who began— deeming eternal truth secure in nearness— to sun myself in heavenly light and clearness and laid aside the earthly man— i more than cherub whose free force had planned to flow through nature’s veins in glad pulsation to reach beyond enjoying in creation the life of gods behold my expiation a thunderword swept from my stand27  with i dare not venture to compare though i possessed the power to draw near the power to keep was denied my hand when that ecstatic moment held i felt myself so small so great

what hollow humming what a sharp clear stroke drives from my lip the goblet’s at their meeting announce the booming bells already woke the first glad hour of easter’s festal greeting choirs have begun the sweet consoling chant which through the night of death the angels ministrant sang god’s new covenant repeating

why in dust entice with your spell gentle powerful sounds of heaven peal rather there where tender natures dwell your messages i hear but faith has not been given the dearest child of faith is miracle i venture not to soar to yonder regions whence the glad tidings hither float and from childhood up familiar with the note to life renews the old allegiance once heavenly love sent down a burning kiss my brow in sabbath silence holy and filled with mystic presage chimed the churchbell slowly and prayer dissolved in a fervent bliss a sweet uncomprehended yearning drove forth my feet through woods and meadows free and while a thousand tears were burning i felt a world arise for these chants to youth and all its sports appealing proclaimed the spring’s rejoicing holiday and memory holds with childish feeling back from the last the solemn way sound on hymns of heaven so sweet and mild my tears gush forth the earth takes back her child

released from ice are brook and river by the quickening glance of the gracious spring the colors of hope to the valley cling and weak old winter himself shiver withdrawn to the mountains a crownless king whence ever retreating he sends again impotent showers of sleet that darkle in belts across the green o’ the plain but the sun will permit no white to sparkle everywhere in development moveth he will brighten the world with the tints he loveth and lacking blossoms blue yellow and red he takes these gaudy people instead turn about and from this height back on the town direct sight out of the hollow gloomy gate the motley throngs come forth elate each will the joy of the sunshine hoard to honor the day of the risen lord they feel themselves their resurrection from the low dark rooms scarce habitable from the bonds of work from trade’s restriction from the pressing weight of roof and gable from the narrow crushing streets and alleys from the churches’ solemn and reverend night all come forth to the cheerful light how lively see the multitude sallies scattering through gardens and fields remote while over the river that broadly dallies dances so a festive boat and overladen nigh to sinking the last full wherry takes the stream yonder afar from the hillpaths blinking their clothes are colors that softly gleam i hear the noise of the village is the people’s proper heaven high and low contented see i am man—dare man to

i take the cup you kindly reach with thanks and health to all and each

no test or trial you evaded a helping god the helper aided

to him above bow down my friends who teaches help and succor sends

a few more steps ascend as far as yonder stone— from our wandering will we rest contented lost in thought i’ve lingered oft alone when foolish fasts and prayers my life tormented rich in hope and firm in faith with tears wrung hands and sighs i’ve striven the end of that farspreading death entreating from the lord of heaven like contempt the crowd’s applauses seem couldst but read within mine inmost spirit how little i deem that sire or son such praises merit my father’s was a sombre brooding brain which through the holy spheres of nature groped and wandered and honestly in his own fashion pondered with labor whimsical and pain who in his dusky workshop bending with proved adepts in company made from his recipes unending

o happy he who renews the hope from error’s deeps to rise forever that which does not know needs to use and what knows uses never but not by such despondence so the fortune of this hour embitter mark how beneath the evening sunlight’s glow the greenembosomed houses glitter the glow retreats done is the day of toil yonder hastes new fields of life exploring ah that no wing can lift from the soil its track to follow follow soaring i see eternal evening gild the silent world beneath glowing on fire each mountainpeak with peace each valley filled the silver brook to golden rivers flowing the mountainchain with all its gorges deep no more impede my godlike motion and before mine eyes expands the ocean with all its bays in shining sleep finally the weary god is sinking the newborn impulse fires my mind— i hasten on his beams eternal drinking the day before and the night behind above heaven unfurled the floor of waves beneath me— a glorious dream though the glories fade alas the wings that lift the mind no aid of wings to lift the body can bequeath in each soul is born the pleasure of yearning onward upward and away when o’er our heads lost in the vaulted azure the lark sends down his flickering lay— when over crags and piny highlands the poising eagle slowly soars and over plains and lakes and islands the crane sails by to other shores

impulse conscious of at best o never seek to know the other two souls alas reside within my breast and each withdraws from and repels its brother with tenacious organs holds in love and clinging lust the world in its embraces the other strongly sweeps this dust above into the high ancestral spaces if there airy spirits near ’twixt heaven and earth on potent errands fleeing them drop down the golden atmosphere and bear forth to new and varied being yea if a magic mantle once were mine to waft o’er the world at pleasure i not for the costliest stores of treasure— not for a monarch’s robe—the gift resign

seest the black dog coursing there through corn and

inspect him close for what tak’st the beast

seest the spiral circles narrowing faster which he approaching round seems to wind a streaming trail of fire if i see rightly follows his path of mystery

seems to that with enchanted cunning he snares our feet some future chain to bind

the circle narrows he is near

come follow come at least

no doubt you’re right no trace of mind i own is in the beast i see but drill alone

behind field and meadow sleeping i leave in deep prophetic night within whose dread and holy keeping the better soul awakes to light the wild desires no longer win the deeds of passion cease to chain the love of man revives within the love of god revives again  poodle make not such racket and riot why at the threshold wilt snuffing behind the stove repose in quiet my softest cushion i give to as up yonder with running and leaping amused on the mountain’s crest  so i take into my keeping a welcome but also a silent guest  ah when within our narrow chamber the lamp with friendly lustre glows flames in the breast each faded ember and in the heart itself that knows hope again lends sweet assistance and reason resumes her speech yearns the rivers of existence the very founts of life to reach  snarl not poodle to the sound that rises the sacred tones that my soul embrace this bestial noise is out of place we are used to see that man despises what he never comprehends and the good and the beautiful vilipends finding them often hard to measure will the dog like man snarl his displeasure  but ah i feel though will thereto stronger contentment flows from out my breast no longer why the stream so soon run dry and fail and burning thirst again assail therein i’ve borne so much probation and this want supplied we call the supernatural to guide we pine and thirst for revelation which nowhere worthier is more nobly sent than in our new testament i feel impelled its meaning to determine— with honest purpose once for all

first to encounter the beast the words of the four addressed

this was the poodle’s real core a travelling scholar the casus is diverting



with all you gentlemen the name’s a test whereby the nature usually is expressed clearly the latter implies in names like beelzebub destroyer father of lies

what hidden sense in this enigma lies

nam’st thyself a part show’st complete to

i see the plan pursuing canst not compass general ruin and on smaller scale begun

so to the actively eternal creative force in cold disdain you oppose the fist infernal whose wicked clench is all in vain some other labor seek rather queer son of chaos to begin

why shouldst ask i don’t perceive though our acquaintance is so recent for further visits leave the window’s the door is yonder a chimney also you behold



well—chance this time has fairly hit and thou’rt prisoner to seems the business has succeeded

try the open windowpane

in hell itself laws are reckoned that’s so might a compact made with you gentlemen—and binding—surely

moment more i ask to remain some pleasant news at least to tell

i have not snares around cast thyself led thyself into the meshes who traps the devil hold him fast not soon a second time he’ll catch a prey so precious

thereto i willingly agree if the diversion pleasant

am i again so foully cheated remains there naught of lofty spiritsway but that a dream the devil counterfeited and that a poodle ran away

a knock come in again my quiet broken





this life of earth whatever my attire pain in its wonted fashion too old am i to play with passion too young to without desire what from the world have i to gain abstain—renounce—refrain such is the everlasting song that in the ears of all men rings— that unrelieved our whole life long each hour in passing hoarsely sings in very terror i at morn awake the verge of bitter weeping to see the day of disappointment break to no hope of mine—not one—its promise keeping— that each joy’s presentiment with wilful cavil diminish with grinning masks of life prevent my mind its fairest work to finish too when night descends how anxiously my couch of sleep i lay there also comes no rest to but some wild dream is sent to fray the god that in my breast is owned can deeply stir the inner sources the god above my powers enthroned he cannot change external forces so by the burden of my days oppressed death is desired and life a thing unblest

o fortunate for whom when victory glances the bloody laurels on the brow he bindeth whom after rapid maddening dances in clasping maidenarms he findeth o that i before that spiritpower ravished and rapt from life had sunken

eavesdropping ha pleasure seems to

though some familiar tone retrieving my thoughts from torment led on and sweet clear echoes came deceiving a faith bequeathed from childhood’s dawn i curse whate’er entices and snares the soul with visions vain with dazzling cheats and dear devices confines in this cave of pain cursed at once the high ambition wherewith the mind itself deludes cursed the glare of apparition that on the finer sense intrudes cursed the lying dream’s impression of name and fame and laurelled brow cursed all that flatters as possession as wife and child as knave and plow cursed mammon when he with treasures to restless action spurs our fate cursed when for soft indulgent leisures he lays for the pillows straight cursed the vine’s transcendent nectar— the highest favor love lets fall cursed also hope—cursed faith the spectre and cursed patience most of all

and what my counterservice therefor

no—no the devil is an egotist and is not apt without a why or “for god’s sake” others to assist speak conditions plain and clear with such a servant danger comes i fear

the there my scruples naught increases when dashed this world to pieces the other its place fill on this earth my pleasures have their sources yon sun beholds my sorrows in his courses and when from these my life itself divorces happen all that can or will i’ll hear no more vain to ponder if there we cherish love or hate or in the spheres we dream of yonder a high and low our souls await

canst poor devil give whatsoever when was a human soul in its supreme endeavor e’er understood by such as food which never satiates now— the restless ruddy gold that runs quicksilverlike one’s fingers through— a game whose winnings no man ever knew— a maid that from my breast beckons my neighbor with her wanton glances and honor’s godlike zest the meteor that a moment dances— show the fruits that ere they’re gathered rot and trees that daily with new leafage clothe them

when on an idler’s bed i stretch myself in quiet there at once my record end canst with lying flattery rule until selfpleased myself i see— canst with rich enjoyment fool that day the last for the bet i offer

a perfect right thereto my powers i have not rashly estimated a slave am i whate’er i do— if thine or whose needless to debate

demand’st pedant too a document never known a man nor proved his word’s intent is’t not enough that what i speak today stand with all my future days agreeing in all its tides sweeps not the world away and a promise bind my being this delusion in our hearts we bear who himself therefrom deliver blest he whose bosom truth makes pure and fair no sacrifice he repent of ever nathless a parchment writ and stamped with care a spectre is which all to shun endeavor the word alas dies in the pen and wax and leather keep the lordship what wilt from base spirit say— brass marble parchment paper clay the terms with graver quill or chisel stated i freely leave the choice to

if therewith fully satisfied so by the farce abide

fear not that i this pact seek to sever the promise that i make to is just the sum of my endeavor i have myself inflated all too high my proper place is estate the mighty spirit deigns no reply and nature shuts on her gate the thread of thought at last is broken and knowledge brings disgust unspoken the sensual deeps explore to quench the fervors of glowing passion every marvel take and fashion through the impervious veil wore plunge we in time’s tumultuous dance in the rush and roll of circumstance

but heard not of joy we’re talking i take the wildering whirl enjoyment’s keenest pain enamored hate exhilarant disdain my bosom of its thirst for knowledge sated not henceforth from any pang wrested and all of life for all mankind created within mine inmost being tested the highest lowest forms my soul borrow heap itself their bliss and sorrow and my own sole self to all their selves expanded i too at last with them all stranded

nay but i will

what am i if denied my part the crown of all humanity to win whereto yearns every sense within

i feel indeed that i have made the treasure of human thought and knowledge mine in vain and if i sit down in restful leisure no fount of newer strength is in my brain i am no hair’sbreadth more in height nor nearer to the infinite



to see him i have no heart



with the flowing beard i wear both ease and grace will fail there the attempt indeed were a futile strife i never could learn the ways of life i feel so small before others and thence should always find embarrassments

how we leave the house and start where servant coach and horses

to leave them is my inclination

these crazy signs of witches’ craft repel



i am not used to that i cannot stoop to try it— to take the spade in hand and ply the narrow being suits not at all

the hag and her alone canst thyself not brew the potion

absurder than i ever did see

who during all this time has been standing before a mirror approaching and retreating from  what do i see what heavenly revealed shows through the glass from magic’s fair dominions o lend love the swiftest of pinions and bear to her beauteous field ah if i leave this spot with fond designing if i attempt to venture near dim as through gathering mist her charms appear— a woman’s in beauty shining can woman so lovely and i find her body there reclining of all the heavens the bright epitome can earth with such a thing mated

woe’s i fear to lose my wits

my bosom burns with that sweet vision with speed away from

what come of this the creatures antic the crazy stuff the gestures frantic— all the repulsive cheats i view— are known to and hated too

she talks like who raves in fever

what nonsense she declaims before my head is nigh to split i fear seems to as if i hear a hundred thousand fools in chorus

rapid glance within the mirror give how beautiful that womanform

fair lady not offend you that arm and escort i lend you

by heaven the girl is wondrous fair of all i’ve seen beyond compare so sweetly virtuous and pure and a little pert sure the lip so red the cheek’s clear dawn  i’ll not forget while the world rolls on how she cast down her timid eyes deep in my heart imprinted lies how short and sharp of speech was she why ’twas a real ecstasy

hear of that girl i’d have possession

the who just went by

and she’s older than fourteen

most worthy pedagogue take heed not a word of moral law spoken i claim i tell all my right and if that image of delight rest not within mine arms tonight at midnight is our compact broken

had i but seven hours for all i should not on the devil call but win her by my own persuasion

without that i have appetite

get something the angel keeps lead thither where she sleeps get a kerchief from her breast— a garter that her knee has pressed

and i see—possess her

can we go thither

a gift for her i bid get

leave alone i beg of

o welcome twilight soft and sweet that breathes throughout this hallowed shrine sweet pain of love bind with fetters fleet the heart that on the dew of hope pine how all around a sense impresses of quiet order and content this poverty what bounty blesses what bliss within this narrow den is pent    receive that in thine open arms departed joy and pain wert wont to gather how oft the children with their ruddy charms hung around this throne where sat the father perchance my love amid the childish band grateful for gifts the holy christmas gave her meekly kissed the grandsire’s withered hand i feel o maid very soul of order and content around whisper— which leads with its motherly control the cloth board bids smoothly unroll the sand beneath feet makes whiter crisper o dearest hand to given to change this hut into a lower heaven

go go i never will retreat

i know not should i do

what ails what is’t gripes elf a face like thine beheld i never

head is out of order sadly much becomes to raving madly

a general practice is the same which jew and king also claim



the darling’s sorrow gives pain get a set for her again the first was not a great display

fix and arrange to my will and on her neighbor try skill don’t a devil stiff as paste but get fresh jewels to her taste

how is under way and soon complete



service pays the other

most wise and first of course we’ll make the journey

if you’ve naught better i’ll tear your pretty plan

and remain’st a sophist liar

and from my heart

hold hold will—if such my flame and for the sense and power intense i seek and cannot find a name range with all my senses through creation craving the speech of inspiration and call this ardor so supernal endless eternal and eternal— is that a devilish lying game

mark this i beg of and spare my lungs henceforth whoever intends to have the right if but his

a look from a word more entertains than all the lore of wisest brains

trust dear heart what men call sensible is oft mere vanity and narrowness

ah that simplicity and innocence ne’er know themselves their holy value and their spell that meekness lowliness the highest graces which nature portions out so lovingly—

no doubt you’re much alone

an angel if like

the purest bliss was surely dower

and angel didst recognize as through the gardengate i came

and forgiv’st my freedom and the blame to my impertinence befitting as the cathedral wert quitting











yes child and this blossomword for speech divine he loves ah know’st what means he loves

o tremble not but this look this warm clasp of hands declare

ah rogue a tease

who’s there



i not you wait

ah can i not remain

spirit sublime gav’st gav’st all for which i prayed not unto in vain countenance revealed in fire gav’st nature as a kingdom grand with power to feel and to enjoy not only cold amazed acquaintance yield’st but grantest that in her profoundest breast i gaze as in the bosom of a friend the ranks of living creatures lead before teaching to know my brothers in air and water and the silent wood and when the storm in forests roars and grinds the giant firs in falling neighbor boughs and neighbor trunks with crushing weight bear down and falling fill the hills with hollow thunders— to the cave secure leadest show’st mine own self and in my breast the deep mysterious miracles unfold and when the perfect moon before my gaze comes up with soothing light around float from every precipice and thicket damp the silvery phantoms of the ages past and temper the austere delight of thought  that nothing can perfect unto man i am conscious with this ecstasy which brings near and nearer to the gods gav’st the comrade whom i no more can do without though cold and scornful he demeans to myself and with a breath a word transforms gifts to nothingness within my breast he fans a lawless fire unwearied for that fair and lovely in desire i hasten to enjoyment and in enjoyment pine to feel desire

there were other work for to plague my day auspicious returnest

there is again proper tone— that bored i thankful

what fresh and vital forces canst guess spring from my commerce with the wilderness but if hadst the power of guessing wouldst devil enough to grudge my soul the blessing





get away with thine offences reprobate name not that fairest thing nor the desire for her sweet body bring again before my halfdistracted senses

am i near and love keeps watch and ward though i were ne’er so far cannot falter i envy the body of the lord the touching of her lips before the altar



what are within her arms the heavenly blisses though i glowing with her kisses do i not always share her need i am the fugitive all houseless roaming the monster without air or rest that like a cataract down rocks and gorges foaming leaps maddened into the abyss’s breast and sidewards she with young unwakened senses within her cabin on the alpine field her simple homely life commences her little world therein concealed and i god’s hate flung o’er had not enough to thrust the stubborn rocks before and strike them into dust she and her peace i undermine hell claimed this sacrifice as thine help devil through the coming pangs to push



leave that my child know’st my love is tender for love my blood and life i surrender and as for faith and church i grant to each his own





my darling who dare “i believe in god” to say ask priest or sage the answer to declare and will seem a mocking play a sarcasm on the asker

hear not falsely sweetest countenance who dare express him and who profess him saying i believe in him

the same thing in all places all hearts that beat beneath the heavenly day— each in its language—say why not i in mine as





nay fear him not my sweetest

there such queer birds however



there is thine antipathy





if ’twould my love i advise

played the spy again

monster wilt nor see nor own how this pure soul of faith so lowly so loving and ineffable—

abortion of filth and fire

what’s that to

how from the window of the sacristy upward th’eternal lamp sends forth a glimmer that lessening sidewards fainter grows and dimmer till darkness closes from the sky the shadows within my bosom gather

meanwhile not the treasure risen which there behind i glimmering see

not a jewel not a ring to deck therewith my darling girl

that’s indeed for painful is to bring no gift when her i visit

so long as in my legs i feel the fresh existence this knotted staff suffices what need to shorten so the way along this labyrinth of vales to wander climb the rocky ramparts yonder wherefrom the fountain flings eternal spray is such delight my steps fain delay the springtime stirs within the fragrant birches and the firtree feels should our limbs escape its gentle searches

how strangely glimmers through the hollows a dreary light like that of dawn its exhalation tracks and follows the deepest gorges faint and wan steam there rolling vapor sweepeth burns the glow through film and haze like a tender thread creepeth like a fountain leaps and plays winds away and in a hundred divided veins the valley braids there in a corner pressed and sundered itself detaches spreads and fades gush the sparkles incandescent like scattered showers of golden sand— but see in all their height at present the rocky ramparts blazing stand

how raves the tempest through the air with what fierce blows my neck beating



spirit of contradiction on i’ll follow straight planned most wisely if i judge aright we climb the brocken’s top in the walpurgisnight that arbitrarily ourselves we isolate

better the summit i own there fire and whirling smoke i see they seek the evil in wild confusion enigmas there might find solution

wilt to introduce to the revel assume the part of wizard or of devil

not lose myself in all this pother this is a fair as never was another

but who is that



those two the old with the young sitting they’ve danced already more than fitting

a lovely dream once came to i beheld an appletree and there two fairest apples shone they lured so i climbed thereon

o everywhere on him you fall when others dance he weighs the matter if he can’t every step bechatter the same as were the step not made but if you forwards go his ire is most displayed if you whirl in regular gyration as he does in his dull old mill he’d show at any rate goodwill— especially if you heard and heeded his hortation

ah in the midst of there sprang a red mouse from her mouth—sufficient reason

saw i—



forsooth the eyes they are of whom dying no hand with loving pressure closed that is the breast whereon i once was lying— the body sweet beside which i reposed

the woe the rapture so ensnare that from her gaze i cannot tear and strange around her fairest throat a single scarlet band is gleaming no broader than a knifeblade seeming

in misery in despair long wretchedly astray on the face of the earth and imprisoned that gracious illstarred creature shut in a dungeon as a criminal and given up to fearful torments to this has come to this—treacherous contemptible spirit and concealed from me—stand then—stand roll the devilish eyes wrathfully in head stand and defy with thine intolerable presence imprisoned in irretrievable misery delivered up to evil spirits and to condemning unfeeling man and lulled meanwhile with the most insipid dissipations concealed from her increasing wretchedness and suffered her to go helplessly to ruin

dog abominable monster transform him infinite spirit transform the reptile again into his dogshape in which pleased him often at night to scamper on before to roll himself at the feet of the unsuspecting wanderer and hang his shoulders when he fell transform him again into his favorite likeness that he crawl his belly in the dust before me—that i trample him the outlawed under foot not the first o woe woe which no human soul can grasp that more than being should sink into the depths of this misery—that the first in its writhing deathagony under the eyes of the eternal forgiver did not expiate the guilt of all others the misery of this single pierces to the very marrow of my life and calmly grinning at the fate of thousands

gnash not devouring teeth at fills with horrible disgust mighty glorious spirit who vouchsafed to thine apparition who knowest my heart and my soul why fetter to the feloncomrade who feeds on mischief and gluts himself with ruin

rescue her or woe to the fearfullest curse for

take thither she free

that too from murder and death of a world monster take thither i say and liberate her



what weave they there round the ravenstone

soaring up sweeping down bowing and bending

they scatter devote and doom

a shudder long unfelt comes o’er mankind’s collected woe o’erwhelms she dwells within the dark damp walls before and all her crime was a delusion dear what i delay to free her i dread once again to see her on my shrinking but lingers death more near    my mother the harlot who put to death my father the varlet

she does not dream her lover listens near that he the rattling chain the rustling straw can hear

hush hush the hour is come that frees

cries will wake the guards and they will seize

i outlive this misery

lieth who loves ever the thraldom of woe to sever









come follow my darling more bold i’ll clasp soon with warmth a thousandfold but follow all i beg of



come come the night already vanisheth

o the past past

if feel’st is i come with



canst just will open stands the door

i’ll stay with



words and prayers are nothing worth i’ll venture to bear forth

the day dawns dearest dearest

o had i ne’er been born

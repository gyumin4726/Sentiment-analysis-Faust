since o lord deignst to approach again and ask how we do in manner kindest and heretofore to meet myself wert fain among menials my face findest pardon this troop i cannot follow after with lofty speech though by them scorned and spurned my pathos certainly move laughter if hadst not all merriment unlearned of suns and worlds ive nothing to quoted how men torment themselves is all ive noted the little god o the world sticks to the same old way and is as whimsical as on creations day life somewhat better might content him but for the gleam of heavenly light which lent him he calls reason—thence his powers increased to far beastlier than any beast saving gracious presence he to a longlegged grasshopper appears to that springing flies and flying springs and in the grass the same old ditty sings he lay among the grass he grows in each bit of dung he seeks to stick his nose in

no lord i find things there bad as they can mans misery to pity moves my nature ive scarce the heart to plague the wretched creature



forsooth he serves you after strange devices no earthly meat or drink the fool suffices his spirits ferment far aspireth half conscious of his frenzied crazed unrest the fairest stars from heaven he requireth from earth the highest raptures and the best and all the near and far that he desireth fails to subdue the tumult of his breast

what will you bet theres a chance to gain him if unto full leave you give gently my road to train him

my thanks i find the dead no acquisition and never cared to have them in my keeping i much prefer the cheeks where ruddy blood is leaping and when a corpse approaches close my house goes with as with the cat the mouse

agreed but tis a short probation about my bet i feel no trepidation if i fulfill my expectation youll triumph with a swelling breast dust he eat and with a zest as did a certain snake my near relation

i like at times to hear the ancients word and have a care to most civil its really kind of such a noble lord so humanly to gossip with the devil       first part of the tragedy

while the vapor is dissipating steps forth from behind the stove in the costume of a travelling scholar why such a noise what are my lords commands

the learned gentleman i bow before youve made roundly sweat thats certain

a question small seems for whose mind the word so much despises who scorning all external gleams the depths of being only prizes

part of that power not understood which always wills the bad and always works the good

i am the spirit that denies and justly so for all things from the void called forth deserve to destroyed twere better were naught created all which you as sin have rated— destruction—aught with evil blent— that is my proper element

the modest truth i speak to if man that microcosmic fool can see himself a whole so frequently part of the part am i once all in primal night— part of the darkness which brought forth the light the haughty light which disputes the space and claims of mother night her ancient place and the struggle fails since light howeer weaves fettered unto bodies cleaves flows from bodies bodies beautifies by bodies is its course impeded and so but little time is needed i hope ere as the bodies die dies

and truly tis not much when all is done that which to naught is in resistance set— the something of this clumsy world—has with all that i have undertaken not been by disturbed or shaken from earthquake tempest wave volcanos brand back into quiet settle sea and land and that damned stuff the bestial human brood— what use in having that to play with how have i made away with and ever circulates a newer fresher blood makes furious such things beholding from water earth and air unfolding a thousand germs break forth and grow in dry and wet and warm and chilly and had i not the flame reserved why really theres nothing special of my own to show



i confess that forth i not wander my steps by slight obstacle controlled— the wizardsfoot that on your threshold made is

inspect the thing the drawings not completed the outer angle you see is open left—the lines dont fit

the poodle naught remarked as after he speeded but other aspects obtain the devil cant get out again

for devils and for spectres this is law where they have entered in there also they withdraw the first is free to were governed by the second

all that is promised delight purely no skinflint bargain see but this is not of swift conclusion talk about the matter soon and i do entreat this boon— leave to withdraw from my intrusion

release i soon come again at will mayst question and compel

ant please also im content to stay and serve in a social station but stipulating that i with arts of mine afford recreation

my friend thoult win past all pretences more in this hour to soothe senses than in the years monotony that which the dainty spirits sing the lovely pictures they bring are more than magics empty show scent will to bliss invited palate with taste delighted nerves of touch ecstatic glow all unprepared the charm i spin were together so begin

he sleeps enough fays your airy number have sung him truly into slumber for this performance i your debtor prove— not the man to catch the fiend and hold him— with fairest images of dreams infold him plunge him in seas of sweet untruth for the thresholds magic which controlled him the devil needs a rats quick tooth i use no lengthened invocation rustles that soon will work my liberation  the lord of rats and eke of mice of flies and bedbugs frogs and lice summons hither to the doorsill to gnaw where with just a morsel of oil he paints the spot for thee— there comst hopping on to to work at once the point which made craven is forward on the ledge engraven another bite makes free the door so dream dreams o faust until we meet once more



thrice the words spoken



and is never death a wholly welcome guest

and by some in that nightly hour a certain liquid was not drunken

omniscient am i not much is known to

these are the small dependants

the time is long needst not insist

an unwearied slave ill wear tether and to thine every nod obedient when there again we come together do the same for

in this sense canst venture come bind thyself by prompt indenture and mine arts with joy see what no man ever saw ill give to

such a demand alarms not such treasures have i and can show them but the time reach good my friend when peace we crave and more luxurious diet

consider my memory good is rated

at the doctorsbanquet i today will as a servant wait behind but thing more beyond all risk to bind give a line or two i pray

why heat thyself instantly

blood is a juice of rarest quality

for you no bound no term is set whether you everywhere trying or snatch a rapid bliss in flying agree with you what you get only fall to and show no timid balking

believe who for a thousand year the same tough meat have chewed and tested that from the cradle to the bier no man the ancient leaven has digested trust of this whole supernal is made but for a gods delight he dwells in splendor single and eternal but he thrusts in darkness out of sight and you he dowers with day and night



why on the whole thourt—what set wigs of million curls head to raise wear shoes an ell in height—the truth betrays and remainest—what

good sir you see the facts precisely as they are seen by each and all we arrange them more wisely before the joys of life pall why zounds both hands and feet are truly— and head and virile forces—thine all that i indulge in newly ist thence less wholly mine if ive six stallions in my stall are not their forces also lent i speed along completest man of all as though my legs were fourandtwenty take hold reflection rest and plunge into the world with zest i say to a speculative wight is like a beast on moorlands lean that round and round some fiend misleads to evil plight while all about lie pastures fresh and green

try a wider sphere what place of martyrdom is ist life i ask ist prudence to bore thyself and bore the students neighbor paunch to that attend why plague thyself with threshing straw forever the best learnest in the end darst not tell the youngsters—never i hear ones footsteps hither steering

so long the poor boy waits a hearing he not unconsoled depart cap and mantle straightway lend ill play the comedy with    my wits certain will befriend but fifteen minutes time is all i need for our fine trip meanwhile prepare thyself with speed

reason and knowledge only despise the highest strength in man that lies but the lying spirit bind with magic works and shows that blind and i have fast and sure— fate such a bold untrammelled spirit gave him as forwards onwards ever endure whose overhasty impulse drave him past earthly joys he might secure dragged through the wildest life will i enslave him through flat and stale indifference with struggling chilling checking so deprave him that to his hot insatiate sense the dream of drink mock but never lave him refreshment his lips in vain implore— had he not made himself the devils naught could save



you have reached the right place

all that depends on habitude so from its mothers breasts a child at first reluctant takes its food but soon to seek them is beguiled at the breasts of wisdom clinging thoult find each day a greater rapture bringing

explain before you further speak the special faculty you seek

is the genuine path for you

use your time flies so swiftly from but time through order won i promise

your mind will shortly set aright when you have learned all things reducing to classify them for your using

and after—first and foremost duty—of metaphysics learn the use and beauty see that you most profoundly gain what does not suit the human brain a splendid word to serve youll find for what goes in—or wont go in—your mind but first at least this half a year to order rigidly adhere five hours a day you understand and when the clock strikes on hand prepare beforehand for your part with paragraphs all got by heart so you can better watch and look that naught is said but what is in the book in writing as unwearied as did the holy ghost dictate to

choose thyself a faculty

nor can i therefore greatly blame you students i know what science this has come to all rights and laws are transmitted like an eternal sickness of the race— from generation unto generation fitted and shifted round from place to place reason becomes a sham beneficence a worry a grandchild therefore woe to the right born with ours in verity this to consider theres alas no hurry

i should not wish to see you misguided for as regards this science hint tis very hard to shun the false direction theres so much secret poison lurking in t so like the medicine baffles your detection hear therefore alone for that is best in sooth and simply take your masters words for truth on words your attention centre through the safest gate youll enter the templehalls of certainty

of course but only shun too oversharp a tension for just where fails the comprehension a word steps promptly in as deputy with words tis excellent disputing systems to words tis easy suiting on words tis excellent believing no word can ever lose a jot from thieving

im tired enough of this dry tone— play the devil again and fully    to grasp the spirit of medicine is easy learn of the great and little world your fill to go at last so please just as god will in vain that through the realms of science you drift each learns only—just what learn he can he who grasps the moments gift he is the proper man wellmade you are tis not to denied the rest a bold address will win you if you but in yourself confide at once confide all others in you to lead the women learn the special feeling their everlasting aches and groans

my worthy friend gray are all theories and green alone lifes golden tree

most willingly to what extent i



follow the ancient text and the snake wast ordered to trample with all likeness to god thoult a sorry example

before all else i bring hither where boon companions meet together to see how smooth life runs away for the folk each days a holiday with little wit and ease to suit them they whirl in narrow circling trails like kittens playing with their tails and if no headache persecute them so long the host credit give they merrily and careless live

not if he had them by the neck i vow eer these people scent the devil

is permitted that we share your leisure in place of cheering drink which seeks vainly your company give pleasure

we passed without a call today at our last interview before we parted much of his cousins did he speak entreating that we should give to each his kindly greeting

if i am right we heard the sound of welltrained voices singing chorus and truly song rebound superbly from the arches oer

o no my wish is great my power is only soso

if you desire a number

weve just retraced our way from spain the lovely land of wine and song and slumber    there was a king once reigning who had a big black flea—

there was a king once reigning who had a big black flea and loved him past explaining as his own son were he he called his man of stitches the tailor came straightway measure the lad for breeches and measure his coat i say

reversing the brush which he has been holding in his hand and striding among the jars and glasses  in two in two there lies the brew there lies the glass the joke will pass as time foul ass to the singing of crew

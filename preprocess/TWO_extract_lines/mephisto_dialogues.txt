since o lord deign’st to approach again and ask how we do in manner kindest and heretofore to meet myself wert fain among menials my face findest pardon this troop i cannot follow after with lofty speech though by them scorned and spurned my pathos certainly move laughter if hadst not all merriment unlearned of suns and worlds i’ve nothing to quoted how men torment themselves is all i’ve noted the little god o’ the world sticks to the same old way and is as whimsical as on creation’s day life somewhat better might content him but for the gleam of heavenly light which lent him he calls reason—thence his power’s increased to far beastlier than any beast saving gracious presence he to a longlegged grasshopper appears to that springing flies and flying springs and in the grass the same old ditty sings he lay among the grass he grows in each bit of dung he seeks to stick his nose in

no lord i find things there bad as they can man’s misery to pity moves my nature i’ve scarce the heart to plague the wretched creature



forsooth he serves you after strange devices no earthly meat or drink the fool suffices his spirit’s ferment far aspireth half conscious of his frenzied crazed unrest the fairest stars from heaven he requireth from earth the highest raptures and the best and all the near and far that he desireth fails to subdue the tumult of his breast

what will you bet there’s a chance to gain him if unto full leave you give gently my road to train him

my thanks i find the dead no acquisition and never cared to have them in my keeping i much prefer the cheeks where ruddy blood is leaping and when a corpse approaches close my house goes with as with the cat the mouse

agreed but a short probation about my bet i feel no trepidation if i fulfill my expectation you’ll triumph with a swelling breast dust he eat and with a zest as did a certain snake my near relation

i like at times to hear the ancient’s word and have a care to most civil it’s really kind of such a noble lord so humanly to gossip with the devil       first part of the tragedy

while the vapor is dissipating steps forth from behind the stove in the costume of a travelling scholar why such a noise what are my lord’s commands

the learned gentleman i bow before you’ve made roundly sweat that’s certain

a question small seems for whose mind the word so much despises who scorning all external gleams the depths of being only prizes

part of that power not understood which always wills the bad and always works the good

i am the spirit that denies and justly so for all things from the void called forth deserve to destroyed ’twere better were naught created all which you as sin have rated— destruction—aught with evil blent— that is my proper element

the modest truth i speak to if man that microcosmic fool can see himself a whole so frequently part of the part am i once all in primal night— part of the darkness which brought forth the light the haughty light which disputes the space and claims of mother night her ancient place and the struggle fails since light howe’er weaves fettered unto bodies cleaves flows from bodies bodies beautifies by bodies is its course impeded and so but little time is needed i hope ere as the bodies die dies

and truly not much when all is done that which to naught is in resistance set— the something of this clumsy world—has with all that i have undertaken not been by disturbed or shaken from earthquake tempest wave volcano’s brand back into quiet settle sea and land and that damned stuff the bestial human brood— what use in having that to play with how have i made away with and ever circulates a newer fresher blood makes furious such things beholding from water earth and air unfolding a thousand germs break forth and grow in dry and wet and warm and chilly and had i not the flame reserved why really there’s nothing special of my own to show

we’ll consider canst gather my views when next i venture in might i perhaps depart at present

i confess that forth i not wander my steps by slight obstacle controlled— the wizard’sfoot that on your threshold made is

inspect the thing the drawing’s not completed the outer angle you see is open left—the lines don’t fit

the poodle naught remarked as after he speeded but other aspects obtain the devil can’t get out again

for devils and for spectres this is law where they have entered in there also they withdraw the first is free to we’re governed by the second

all that is promised delight purely no skinflint bargain see but this is not of swift conclusion we’ll talk about the matter soon and i do entreat this boon— leave to withdraw from my intrusion

release i soon come again at will mayst question and compel

an’t please also i’m content to stay and serve in a social station but stipulating that i with arts of mine afford recreation

my friend thou’lt win past all pretences more in this hour to soothe senses than in the year’s monotony that which the dainty spirits sing the lovely pictures they bring are more than magic’s empty show scent will to bliss invited palate with taste delighted nerves of touch ecstatic glow all unprepared the charm i spin we’re together so begin

he sleeps enough fays your airy number have sung him truly into slumber for this performance i your debtor prove— not the man to catch the fiend and hold him— with fairest images of dreams infold him plunge him in seas of sweet untruth for the threshold’s magic which controlled him the devil needs a rat’s quick tooth i use no lengthened invocation rustles that soon will work my liberation  the lord of rats and eke of mice of flies and bedbugs frogs and lice summons hither to the doorsill to gnaw where with just a morsel of oil he paints the spot for thee— there com’st hopping on to to work at once the point which made craven is forward on the ledge engraven another bite makes free the door so dream dreams o faust until we meet once more



thrice the words spoken



and is never death a wholly welcome guest

and by some in that nightly hour a certain liquid was not drunken

omniscient am i not much is known to

these are the small dependants

the time is long need’st not insist

an unwearied slave i’ll wear tether and to thine every nod obedient when there again we come together do the same for

in this sense canst venture come bind thyself by prompt indenture and mine arts with joy see what no man ever saw i’ll give to

such a demand alarms not such treasures have i and can show them but the time reach good my friend when peace we crave and more luxurious diet

consider my memory good is rated

at the doctors’banquet i today will as a servant wait behind but thing more beyond all risk to bind give a line or two i pray

why heat thyself instantly

blood is a juice of rarest quality

for you no bound no term is set whether you everywhere trying or snatch a rapid bliss in flying agree with you what you get only fall to and show no timid balking

believe who for a thousand year the same tough meat have chewed and tested that from the cradle to the bier no man the ancient leaven has digested trust of this whole supernal is made but for a god’s delight he dwells in splendor single and eternal but he thrusts in darkness out of sight and you he dowers with day and night



why on the whole thou’rt—what set wigs of million curls head to raise wear shoes an ell in height—the truth betrays and remainest—what

good sir you see the facts precisely as they are seen by each and all we arrange them more wisely before the joys of life pall why zounds both hands and feet are truly— and head and virile forces—thine all that i indulge in newly is’t thence less wholly mine if i’ve six stallions in my stall are not their forces also lent i speed along completest man of all as though my legs were fourandtwenty take hold reflection rest and plunge into the world with zest i say to a speculative wight is like a beast on moorlands lean that round and round some fiend misleads to evil plight while all about lie pastures fresh and green

we’ll try a wider sphere what place of martyrdom is is’t life i ask is’t prudence to bore thyself and bore the students neighbor paunch to that attend why plague thyself with threshing straw forever the best learnest in the end dar’st not tell the youngsters—never i hear one’s footsteps hither steering

so long the poor boy waits a hearing he not unconsoled depart cap and mantle straightway lend i’ll play the comedy with    my wits certain will befriend but fifteen minutes’ time is all i need for our fine trip meanwhile prepare thyself with speed

reason and knowledge only despise the highest strength in man that lies but the lying spirit bind with magic works and shows that blind and i have fast and sure— fate such a bold untrammelled spirit gave him as forwards onwards ever endure whose overhasty impulse drave him past earthly joys he might secure dragged through the wildest life will i enslave him through flat and stale indifference with struggling chilling checking so deprave him that to his hot insatiate sense the dream of drink mock but never lave him refreshment his lips in vain implore— had he not made himself the devil’s naught could save



you have reached the right place

all that depends on habitude so from its mother’s breasts a child at first reluctant takes its food but soon to seek them is beguiled at the breasts of wisdom clinging thou’lt find each day a greater rapture bringing

explain before you further speak the special faculty you seek

is the genuine path for you

use your time flies so swiftly from but time through order won i promise

your mind will shortly set aright when you have learned all things reducing to classify them for your using

and after—first and foremost duty—of metaphysics learn the use and beauty see that you most profoundly gain what does not suit the human brain a splendid word to serve you’ll find for what goes in—or won’t go in—your mind but first at least this half a year to order rigidly adhere five hours a day you understand and when the clock strikes on hand prepare beforehand for your part with paragraphs all got by heart so you can better watch and look that naught is said but what is in the book in writing as unwearied as did the holy ghost dictate to

choose thyself a faculty

nor can i therefore greatly blame you students i know what science this has come to all rights and laws are transmitted like an eternal sickness of the race— from generation unto generation fitted and shifted round from place to place reason becomes a sham beneficence a worry a grandchild therefore woe to the right born with ours in verity this to consider there’s alas no hurry

i should not wish to see you misguided for as regards this science hint very hard to shun the false direction there’s so much secret poison lurking in ’t so like the medicine baffles your detection hear therefore alone for that is best in sooth and simply take your master’s words for truth on words your attention centre through the safest gate you’ll enter the templehalls of certainty

of course but only shun too oversharp a tension for just where fails the comprehension a word steps promptly in as deputy with words excellent disputing systems to words easy suiting on words excellent believing no word can ever lose a jot from thieving

i’m tired enough of this dry tone— play the devil again and fully    to grasp the spirit of medicine is easy learn of the great and little world your fill to go at last so please just as god will in vain that through the realms of science you drift each learns only—just what learn he can he who grasps the moment’s gift he is the proper man wellmade you are not to denied the rest a bold address will win you if you but in yourself confide at once confide all others in you to lead the women learn the special feeling their everlasting aches and groans

my worthy friend gray are all theories and green alone life’s golden tree

most willingly to what extent i



follow the ancient text and the snake wast ordered to trample with all likeness to god thou’lt a sorry example



my friend soon lose all such misgiving but selfpossessed the of living

we’ll spread this cloak with proper through the air direct our courses but only on so bold a flight sure to have luggage light a little burning air which i soon prepare above the earth will nimbly bear and if we’re light we’ll travel swift and clear i gratulate on new career

before all else i bring hither where boon companions meet together to see how smooth life runs away for the folk each day’s a holiday with little wit and ease to suit them they whirl in narrow circling trails like kittens playing with their tails and if no headache persecute them so long the host credit give they merrily and careless live

not if he had them by the neck i vow e’er these people scent the devil

is permitted that we share your leisure in place of cheering drink which seeks vainly your company give pleasure

we passed without a call today at our last interview before we parted much of his cousins did he speak entreating that we should give to each his kindly greeting

if i am right we heard the sound of welltrained voices singing chorus and truly song rebound superbly from the arches o’er

o no my wish is great my power is only soso

if you desire a number

we’ve just retraced our way from spain the lovely land of wine and song and slumber    there was a king once reigning who had a big black flea—

there was a king once reigning who had a big black flea and loved him past explaining as his own son were he he called his man of stitches the tailor came straightway measure the lad for breeches and measure his coat i say

in silk and velvet gleaming he was wholly drest— had a coat with ribbons streaming a cross his breast he had the first of stations a minister’s star and name and also all his relations great lords at court became  and the lords and ladies of honor were plagued awake and in bed the queen she got them her the maids were bitten and bled and they did not dare to brush them or scratch them day or night we crack them and we crush them at once whene’er they bite

i fain drink with you my glass to freedom clinking if ’twere a better wine that i see you drinking

did i not fear the landlord might complain i’d treat these worthy guests with pleasure to some from out our cellar’s treasure



give of your taste some intimation

the choice is free make up your minds

boring a hole in the edge of the table at the place where



bores in the meantime has made the wax stoppers and plugged the holes with them

tokay flow at once to fill you

o no with gentlemen of such pretence that were to venture far indeed speak out and make your choice with speed with what a vintage can i serve you

grapes the vinestem bears horns the hegoat wears the grapes are juicy the vines are wood the wooden table gives wine as good into the depths of nature peer— only believe there’s a miracle  draw the stoppers and drink your fill

but have a care that you nothing spill

see the race is happy—it is free

take notice first their bestiality will make a brilliant demonstration





false word and of air change place and sense ensnare here—and there

loose error from their eyes the band and how the devil jests enlightened

once more my friend talkest sensibly there is to make young a simpler mode and apter but in another book writ for and is a most eccentric chapter

good the method is revealed without or gold or magic or physician betake thyself to yonder field there hoe and dig as condition restrain thyself sense and will within a narrow sphere to flourish with unmixed food body nourish live with the ox as ox and think not a theft that manur’st the acre which reapest— that trust is the best mode left whereby for eighty years youth keepest

to thine aid the witch call

that were a charming sport i own i’d build a thousand bridges meanwhile i’ve a notion not and science serve alone patience in the work shown long is the calm brain active in creation time only strengthens the fine fermentation and all belonging thereunto is rare and strange howe’er you take the devil taught the thing true and the devil cannot make  see what a delicate race they that is the maid the man is he  seems the mistress has gone away

what time takes she for dissipating

how findest the tender creatures

why just such talk as this for is that which has the most attractive features    but tell cursed puppets why do stir the porridge so

a great public you can show

how the ape sure his luck enhances could he but try the lottery’s chances  in the meantime the young apes have been playing with a large ball which they roll forward

what means the sieve

and what’s this pot



why surely if a god first plagues himself six days

my own head is really nigh to sinking

at least make this admission— they’re poets genuine and sincere  the caldron which the sheape has up to this time neglected to watch begins to boil over there ensues a great flame which blazes out the chimney the witch comes careering down through the flame with terrible cries

reversing the brush which he has been holding in his hand and striding among the jars and glasses  in two in two there lies the brew there lies the glass the joke will pass as time foul ass to the singing of crew    ha know’st abomination know’st at last lord and master what hinders from smiting and monkeysprites with fell disaster for the scarlet coat no reverence recognize no more the tall cock’sfeather have i concealed this countenance— tell my name old face of leather

this time i’ll ’scape the debt for since we two together met verily full a day culture which smooth the whole world licks also unto the devil sticks the days of that old northern phantom are over where canst horns and tail and claws discover and as regards the foot which i can’t spare in truth ’twould only make the people shun therefore i’ve worn like a spindly youth false calves these years

woman from such a name refrain

it’s long been written in the book of fable therefore no whit better men we see the evil has left the evil ones are stable sir baron call is the matter good a cavalier am i like others in my bearing no doubt about my noble blood see here’s the coatofarms that i am wearing

my friend take proper heed i pray to manage witches this is just the way

give a goblet of the wellknown juice but i beg you of the oldest brewage the years a double strength produce

he is a friend of mine with whom will agree and he deserves kitchen’s best potation come draw circle speak thine adjuration and fill goblet full and free

o nonsense that’s a thing for laughter don’t so terribly severe she juggles you as doctor that after the beverage work the proper cheer

thou’lt hear much more before we leave her all the same the book i can repeat such time i’ve squandered o’er the history

o sibyl excellent enough of adjuration but hither bring potation and quickly fill the beaker to the brim this drink will bring my friend no injuries he is a man of manifold degrees and draughts are known to him  the witch with ceremonies pours the drink into a cup as faust sets to his lips a light flame arises  down with quickly drain off ’twill warm heart with new desire with the devil hand and glove and wilt afraid of fire

and away dar’st not rest

wish on walpurgis night expressed what boon i have given unto

no no the paragon of all believe soon see alive and warm    thou’lt find this drink blood compelling each woman beautiful as helen



she there she’s coming from confession of every sin absolved for i behind her chair was listening nigh so innocent is she indeed that to confess she had no need i have no power o’er souls so green

how you’re talking like jack rake who every flower for himself take and fancies there are no favors more nor honors save for him in store always doesn’t the thing succeed

but think the chances of the case i need at least a fortnight’s space to find an opportune occasion

you almost like a frenchman prate pray don’t take as annoyance why all at once exhaust the joyance your bliss is by no means so great as if you’d use to get control all sorts of tender rigmarole and knead and shape her to your thought as in italian tales taught

but leave jesting out of sight i tell you once for all that speed with this fair girl will not succeed by storm she cannot captured we make use of strategy

that you see how much i’d fain further and satisfy your pain we will no longer lose a minute i’ll find her room today and take you in





presents at once that’s good he’s certain to get at her full a pleasant place i know and treasures buried long ago i perforce look up the matter exit

come in but gently follow

not every girl keeps things so neat

quick i see her there returning

is a casket not unmeet which elsewhere i have just been earning set in the press with haste i swear ’twill turn her head to spy some baubles i therein had placed that you might win another by true child is child and play is play



by all love ever rejected by hellfire hot and unsparing i wish i knew something worse that i might use for

i myself unto the devil deliver if i were not a devil myself

just think the pocket of a priest should get the trinkets left for margaret the mother saw them and instanter a secret dread began to haunt her keen scent has she for tainted air she snuffs within her book of prayer and smells each article to see if sacred or profane so she guessed from every gem that not much blessing came with them “my child” she said “illgotten good ensnares the soul consumes the blood before the mother of god we’ll lay with heavenly manna she’ll repay it” but margaret thought with sour grimace “a gifthorse is not out of place and truly godless cannot the who brought such things to me” a parson came by the mother bidden he saw at once where the game was hidden and viewed with a favor stealthy he spake “that is the proper view— who overcometh winneth too the holy church has a stomach healthy eaten a land as forfeit and never complained of surfeit the church alone beyond all question has for illgotten goods the right digestion”

bagged the spangles chains and rings as if but toadstools were the things and thanked no less and thanked no more than if a sack of nuts he bore— promised them fullest heavenly pay and deeply edified were they



o yes the gentleman finds all child’splay

yes gracious sir in all obedience

that i so boldly introduce i beg you ladies to excuse    for martha schwerdtlein i’d inquire

is enough that you are she you’ve a visitor of high degree pardon the freedom i have ta’en— will after noon return again

ah not alone the jewelry the look the manner both betray— rejoiced am i that i stay

i i had a more cheerful strain take not unkindly its repeating your husband’s dead and sends a greeting

hear relate the mournful tale

joy follows woe woe after joy comes flying

in padua buried he is lying beside the good saint antony within a grave consecrated for cool eternal rest created

yes of weight with sighs three hundred masses buy to save him from perdition my hands are empty otherwise

madam is a grief to on my word his cash was put to proper uses besides his penitence was very sore and he lamented his ill fortune all the more

you deserve a speedy marriageoffer you are so kind compassionate

if not a husband a beau for you is the greatest heavenly blessing to have a dear thing for one’s caressing

custom or not happens though

i stood beside his bed of dying ’twas something better than manure— halfrotten straw and he died a christian sure and found that heavier scores to his account were lying he cried “i find my conduct wholly hateful to leave my wife my trade in manner so ungrateful ah the remembrance makes die of my wrong to her i might shriven”

“yet she god knows was more to blame than i”

in the last throes his senses wandered if i such things but half can judge he said “i had no time for play for gaping freedom first children and work for bread to feed ’em— for bread in the widest sense to drudge and could not eat my share in peace and quiet”

not so the memory of touched him quite said he “when i from malta went away my prayers for wife and little ones were zealous and such a luck from heaven befell we made a turkish merchantman our prey that to the soldan bore a mighty treasure i received as was most fit since bravery was paid in fullest measure my wellapportioned share of it”

who knows whither the four winds have blown a fair young damsel took him in her care as he in naples wandered round unfriended and she much love much faith to him did bear so that he felt till his days were ended

but see he’s dead therefrom at last were i in your place do not doubt i’d mourn him decently a year and for another keep meanwhile my eyes about

that might have done however if he had only been as clever and treated your slips with as little heed i swear with this condition too i myself change rings with you

i’ll cut away betimes from she’d take the devil at his word i fear    how fares the heart within your breast



yes my good dame a pair of witnesses always the truth establishes i have a friend of high condition who’ll also add his deposition i’ll bring him

and this young lady will present too a gallant youth has travelled far ladies with him delighted are

before no king that could named

ah bravo do i find you burning margaret soon will your yearning at neighbor martha’s you’ll this evening meet a fitter woman ne’er was made to ply the pimp and gypsy trade

something is required from

we’ve but to make a deposition valid that her husband’s limbs outstretched and pallid at padua rest in consecrated soil

sancta simplicitas no need of such a toil depose with knowledge or without either

there you are o holy man is the first time in your life you’re driven to bear false witness in a case of god the world and all that in has a place of man and all that moves the being of his race have you not terms and definitions given with brazen forehead daring breast and if you’ll probe the thing profoundly knew you so much—and you’ll confess roundly— as of schwerdtlein’s death and place of rest

yes knew i not more deeply desire for wilt not no lover fairer poor margaret flatter and ensnare her and all soul’s devotion swear her



and i’m right

alas that trade and duty so harry with what a pang leaves so a spot and dares not and to tarry

i dread to see how such a fate advances

but depends the like of you and i should turn to better ways than flirting

the proverb says one’s own warm hearth and a good wife are gold and jewels worth

i’ve everywhere in fact been entertained politely

should allow one’s self to jest with ladies never

i’m sorry i’m so blind but i am sure—that you are very kind



flown up the alley yonder

and she of him so runs the world away



tis time to separate

have you not led this life quite long enough how can a further test delight you very that once tries the stuff but something new requite you

i’ll engage to darest not tell so in earnest the loss of were truly very slight— comrade crazy rude repelling    has one’s hands full all the day and night if what does or leaves undone is right from such a face as thine there is no telling

poor son of earth how couldst alone have led life bereft of i for a time at least have worked cure fancy’s rickets plague not at all had i not been so hadst sure walked thyself off this earthly ball why to caverns rocky hollows slinking sit’st as ’twere an owl ablinking why suck’st from sodden moss and dripping stone

a blessing drawn from supernatural fountains in night and dew to lie the mountains all heaven and earth in rapture penetrating thyself to godhood haughtily inflating to grub with yearning force through earth’s dark marrow compress the six days’ work within bosom narrow— to taste i know not what in haughty power thine own ecstatic life on all things shower thine earthly self behind cast and the lofty instinct thus—    at last— daren’t say how—to pluck the final flower

yes findest that unpleasant the moral right to cry “shame” at present dares not that before chaste ears declare which chaste hearts notwithstanding cannot spare and once for all i grudge not the pleasure of lying to thyself in moderate measure but such a course wilt not long endure already o’erexcited and if last wilt soon plighted to madness and to horror sure enough of that love sits lonely yonder by all things saddened and oppressed her thoughts and yearnings seek tenderer fonder— mighty love is in her breast first came passion’s flood and poured around her as when from melted snow a streamlet overflows therewith so filled and drowned her that stream all shallow shows methinks instead of in the forests lording the noble sir should find good the love of this young silly blood at once to set about rewarding her time is miserably long she haunts her window watching clouds that stray o’er the old citywall and far away “were i a little bird” so runs her song day long and half night long she is lively mostly sad wept beyond her tears again quiet she appears—always

ha do i trap

what wouldst she thinks that flown and half and half i own

very my envy oft reposes on your twinpair that feed among the roses

you rail and is fun to the god who fashioned youth and maid perceived the noblest purpose of his trade and also made their opportunity go on is a woe profound for your sweetheart’s room you’re bound and not for death indeed

again seethes again glows fool go in and comfort her when such a head as thine no outlet knows thinks the end soon occur hail him who keeps a steadfast mind else the devilnature wear naught so insipid in the world i find as is a devil in despair

the monkey is she gone

i’ve heard most fully how she drew the doctor has been catechised plain great good i hope the thing will do the girls have much desire to ascertain if is prim and good as ancient rules compel if there he’s led they think he’ll follow them as

full of sensual supersensual desire a girl by the nose is leading

and how masterly she reads physiognomy when i am present she’s impressed she knows not how she in my mask a hidden sense read she feels that surely i’m a genius now— perhaps the very devil indeed well—tonight—

my delight ’twill also

i’m like a sentimental tomcat rather that round the tall fireladders sweeps and stealthy along the coping creeps quite virtuous withal i come a little thievish and a little frolicsome i feel in every limb the presage forerunning the grand walpurgisnight day after tomorrow brings its message and keeps watch with delight

soon experience the pleasure to lift the kettle with its treasure i lately gave therein a squint— saw splendid liondollars in ’t

i saw among the rest a thing that seemed to a chain of pearl

shouldst not find so annoying without return to enjoying while the sky leads forth its starry throng thou’lt hear a masterpiece no work completer i’ll sing her first a moral song the surer afterwards to cheat her

the cither’s smashed for nothing more fitting

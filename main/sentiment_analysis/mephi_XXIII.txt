she is not the first.
now we are already again at the end of our wits, where the understanding of you men runs wild.
why didst thou enter into fellowship with us, if thou canst not carry it out?
wilt fly, and art not secure against dizziness?
did we thrust ourselves upon thee, or thou thyself upon us?
hast thou done?
i cannot loosen the bonds of the avenger, nor undo his bolts.
rescue her?
who was it that plunged her into ruin?
i, or thou?
wilt thou grasp the thunder?
well that it has not been given to you, miserable mortals!
to crush to pieces the innocent respondent—that is the tyrant-fashion of relieving one’s self in embarrassments.
and the danger to which thou wilt expose thyself?
know that the guilt of blood, from thy hand, still lies upon the town!
avenging spirits hover over the spot where the victim fell, and lie in wait for the returning murderer.
i will convey thee there; and hear, what i can do!
have i all the power in heaven and on earth?
i will becloud the jailer’s senses: get possession of the key, and lead her forth with human hand!
i will keep watch: the magic steeds are ready, i will carry you off.
so much is in my power.

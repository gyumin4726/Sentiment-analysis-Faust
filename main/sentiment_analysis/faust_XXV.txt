a shudder, long unfelt, comes o’er me; mankind’s collected woe o’erwhelms me, here.
she dwells within the dark, damp walls before me, and all her crime was a delusion dear!
what!
i delay to free her?
i dread, once again to see her?
on!
my shrinking but lingers death more near.
_my mother, the harlot, who put me to death; my father, the varlet, who eaten me hath!
little sister, so good, laid my bones in the wood, in the damp moss and clay:_ _then was i a beautiful bird o’ the wood; fly away!
fly away_!
faust __  she does not dream her lover listens near; that he the rattling chain, the rustling straw, can hear.
_
hush!
hush!
the hour is come that frees thee.
thy cries will wake the guards, and they will seize thee!
shall i outlive this misery?
here lieth one who loves thee ever, the thraldom of thy woe to sever.
margaret!
margaret!
’tis i!
come!
come with me!
away, now!
if longer here thou stayest, we shall be made to dearly rue it.
come, follow me!
my darling, be more bold: i’ll clasp thee, soon, with warmth a thousand-fold; but follow now!
’tis all i beg of thee.
’tis i!
come on!
come!
come!
the night already vanisheth.
o, let the past be past!
thy words will slay me!
if thou feel’st it is i, then come with me!
to freedom.
thou canst!
just will it!
open stands the door.
i’ll stay with thee.
recall thy wandering will!
one step, and thou art free at last!
here words and prayers are nothing worth; i’ll venture, then, to bear thee forth.
the day dawns: dearest!
dearest!
o had i ne’er been born!
thou shalt live.
